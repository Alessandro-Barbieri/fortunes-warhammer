And behold, a Daemon Lord comes in the
full panoply of battle. At his passing, the
trees gibber their rage and the stones shout
their hate to the uncaring sky. He hunts the
enemies of his Master, for his meat is
mortal flesh and his wine mortal souls.

At his left hand moans a Daemon, bound in
the shape of an axe. Its songs of blood and
hatred echo forth, and fill the sky with a
moaning that stirs the dead. At his right
hand stand Lesser Daemons, huntsmen all,
straining at the leashes of the Hounds.
They chomp upon the shades and spirits
they have harried, throwing morsels of
innocence to each other, so that all may
sample the sweetest meat.

Behind him wait the Legions of his Master,
arrayed in armour fluted and chased with
gold, brighter than the sun and darker than
midnight. Each holds a shrieking sword,
each shrieks in disharmony with his blade,
each joins the chorus of Chaos, a promise
of worse than death for those that hear it.
Beneath their feet the earth writhes at
their touch, as if seeking to escape
their presence.

Behold, a Daemon Lord comes, and we
are doomed...

And to tell of his Beast:
the like of it has never been
seen. He came upon a
mighty steed of groaning
iron and brazen steel, a
thing of living metal that
stood taller than a man and
roared with all the furies of
a thousand dead. He sat
securely proud in a deep
saddle that grew out the
very back of this accursed
Beast, its high posts
framing a massive head,
part hound, part bull, part
the incarnate soul of bloody
hate. As it came toward us
we saw its thousand close-
riveted plates, forged in
dark fires and bound with
runes. Its breath was fear
and its every step a
thundering knell of doom.
As it bared its brazen, gore-
speckled fangs, we lost all
heart and turned, fleeing to
the safety of the night and
terrors still unseen.

“I shall tell you of the Singular Histories and Lamentable Fates of the brothers von Gottlieb...
Look into the fire, gentles, for my words can paint pictures in the flames. Look deep, and
drift slowly on the heat...”

The old man closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair. His voice was soft and warm
in the candlelit gloom.

“Lothar and Johann von Gottlieb. Regard them, in their fine silks and soft leathers. They
crave power, glory, success and all that accompanies such - much as do other men. They
are ambitious, and in this they match their father, but of him I will speak no further; the
old Baron is not yet in his grave.

“Darkness in their hearts. They have listened, watched and learned, understanding little,
Slaanesh has promised Lothar pleasures beyond pleasure. Khorne has offered nothing,
but Johann demands nothing. He has already killed, and found it to his taste. See, now
the two hate each other! Brotherly love often turns to the deepest hate.

“And their hate drove them from home, into the bosom of the Chaos Powers. Did Johann
chase Lothar, seeking his blood? Or did he run from the decadent pleasures Lothar
sought in his company? It matters not. Each chose the steep and slippery path of Chaos,
hatred the first handhold, the loathing of a brother the first step. Now begins the scramble!
‘Such a short, easy climb,’ croons Slaanesh. ‘A true warrior has no fear,’ bellows Khorne!

“Their climb can end in but one of the two ways: the triumphant shriek, voiced from the throat
of a newly-birthed Daemon, or the gibbering of a once-man, a Chaos Spawn, wallowing
in the stench of its own failure, condemned by Fate and abandoned by Mercy. Which
fate is worse? Ah, now there is a question...”

“Johann von Gottlieb. Murderer, hater, willing servant of Khorne. His bloody road
led him deeper into Chaos. He was unwise when he first killed, and with each killing
his folly grew. Each death marked him as Khorne's own, each frop of blood raised
him in Khorne's sight. But it was his last killing as a true man that marked him out:
Johann slaughtered one of Khorne's Champions.

“In that moment he bellowed his victory to the sky. The Champion's blood was for
Khorne. The Champion's armour, a suit of darkest metal, forged in some far smithy
of Chaos, was for Johann. In that moment, Johann's handhold was firm, his reach
was long enough for the climb ahead. And in that moment, the darkness within burst
free, and Johann was marked as the Blood God's servant. Two terrible curved horns,
like those of a ram, sprouted from his forehead.

“And what of the other Gottlieb? There are many roads to Chaos, and Lothar
galloped down his chosen path. Nothing was beyond him. No creature, man, woman
or child, living or dead, was safe from his depravity. His behaviour would have shamed
a Bretonnian.”

At the back of the room a young woman sniggered and leaned forward in her chair.
The old man sipped his wine and held up a finger. Questions died on the girl's lips.

“I will say no more of that. But, young lady, you also wish to know whether Lothar
was marked by Chaos. You want to know whether you could see the mark... as if that
proved his guilt. Lothar was tainted from the moment he began his climb towards the
power and pleasure of Slaanesh!

“His loyalty was hidden from casual eyes. It was his hands, my dear, his hands. Fools
wondered why Lothar always wore gloves, and pitied his rheumatic fingers. The creature
within had shown itself, and Lothar's long, clever fingers had become bestial claws.
The first mark of Slaanesh was made, and Lothar bore it with quiet and
misguided pride...

Servants of Khorne...

Stood from horizon to horizon, filling the air with their shrieks, gibbers and howls
of blood. Their battle banner strained in the coppery wind that blew across their
ranks. It was a banner of deepest, darkest red, with but a single rune and a legend
of simple devotion: Blood for the Blood God. At some secret signal all fell silent,
and then came a single shriek of dark and bloody loyalty, a pact of hate and death.
It echoed from leathered skins, and grew to shake the clouds. And far above the Daemon's ranks,
there was an answering roar of approval, torn from Khorne's brazen throat.
                                                                            - The Tome of Blood

Servants of Slaanesh...

...by their incantations, conjurations and accursed crafts have seduced, depraved
and corrupted both Man and Beast, bringing them low in the sight of others.
Numberless are their enormities and horrid offences; heinous and wicked their
every action. Revelling in perversity and debasement, twisted in mind and body,
these insidious servitors of the Pleasure Lord take delight in all manner of
abominable and unclean deeds. The Slaaneshi spread the depravity of Chaos to the unwary and
uncaring with heretical crimes and disobediences that cry out against nature and the true order
of the world.

Amassed on the field of battle, the electric colours of their contorted forms offend the eye as their
diseased lewdness offends the mind. Half-bared torsos of pink and blue boast of unreined lust;
others display limbs of glistening greens and yellows - pale shades of corruption which belle the
darkness they hide inside. They have abandoned the last vestige of true decency and sacrificed
their Humanity to serve the Dark Power of the Master of Carnal Joys and spread his corruption
among the innocent...

The Inevitable City

The City was built of dark madness, and it stretched across the
land to fill me with dread, for the path I trod would bring me
to its portal. The City stones had been quarried from the night
and in all their details and dressings they celebrated wickedness.
No rain could wash the dust of evil from that place and no wind
could drive out its corrupt air. Insanity had served as architect,
engineer and master to the City's masons, had guided all
their levels and plumblines.

I turned my steps towards the far horizon, and still the City was
before me. Once more I turned, and again, and yet another
turning. With each freshly chosen course I drew nearer to the
City gates, and its towers and walls loomed higher. The fateful
gateway was the end of every road, and despair gnawed at my heart.

As I paused to seek a new escape, I saw that I was not alone on
the inevitable, hideous path. Between myself and the City stood
a man, his head bent and his eyes downcast, lost in some deep
contemplation. As I watched, he turned towards the City. His
strides were firm, but he came no closer to the gates until he
vanished in the distant mists.

Thus was it possible to avoid the City and its brooding darkness,
and I resolved to march, against all reason, to the City. And when
I did so, the City grew no closer, but was soon lost to my sigth...

The Marcher Fortress

There, the lands of Slaanesh stretched out below it, was a Fortress
of whimsies and foibles. It was an unlovely thing, stained by war
and victory. Its towers, higher than any palace, wounded the sky.
Its gateways were gaping maws that could swallow and vomit forth
whole armies. Its walls were darkened stone, veined in unnatural
colours and streaked with rotted lime and mortar. Here, at the
Marches of Slaanesh, was the Fortress, a sign of sovereignty, hated
and condemned by Khorne's bloody-handed worshippers.

Before the Fortress gates stretched a forest o death. From the
walls to the near horizon was the dismal wrack of battle: corpses,
the rusted swords and armour of the fallen, the standards of
Slaanesh and Khorne, all abandoned and forgotten long
centuries ago.

The graves of the fallen had become a rich loam, sucked upon
by the trees of a dark forest. Pierced by tree roots, the dead had
stirred once more, and each branch bore a skull, mildewed and
pregnant with loathing, a macabre and cruel cargo. Only the
ceaseless, horrendous laughter of the trapped shades disturbed
the field. Their fleshless jaws clattered in the still air; the only
reply the creaking of a windmill's sails and the grinding of
its stones.

For in the shadow of the castle a windmill turned, its sails moving
in the still air, and their unclean breeze stirred the tattered flags
of the dead. Within, the grindstones shuddered and groaned, while
between, pinioned and crushed, were the living corpses of the
fallen, ground to make a rich mortar of blood and bone, sinew
and brains. Thus was the Fortress maintained and strengthened,
its walls held aloft and marked by the power of mortality. Thus
was the field before it harvested.

And in the castle's mighty halls, its Daemon overlords feasted
and broke bread, in conscious parody of Man's small amenities.
All this I saw in an instant, and then my vision was swept
onwards...

Their baying chills the heart and spreads icy
tendrils of fear through weak mortal sols.
And yet worse, yet more terrible to behold, are
the huntsmen of this fell pack. Following
close upon the Hounds, urging them ever
forward, come deformed beings, running and
shrieking, shrieking and running, driven by
the stateless bloodlust of their kind. With
twisted crimson frames they speed across the
blighted land, crouched over as if the better to
track the terror-spoor of their prey. Masters of
the Hunt, they seek the blood of Man to offer
at the foot of the Skull Throne, ever hungry
for fresh prey, ever willing to tear the warm
red flesh with their talons and to smear the
gore triumphant upon their curving horns.
