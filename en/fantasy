And behold, a Daemon Lord comes in the
full panoply of battle. At his passing, the
trees gibber their rage and the stones shout
their hate to the uncaring sky. He hunts the
enemies of his Master, for his meat is
mortal flesh and his wine mortal souls.

At his left hand moans a Daemon, bound in
the shape of an axe. Its songs of blood and
hatred echo forth, and fill the sky with a
moaning that stirs the dead. At his right
hand stand Lesser Daemons, huntsmen all,
straining at the leashes of the Hounds.
They chomp upon the shades and spirits
they have harried, throwing morsels of
innocence to each other, so that all may
sample the sweetest meat.

Behind him wait the Legions of his Master,
arrayed in armour fluted and chased with
gold, brighter than the sun and darker than
midnight. Each holds a shrieking sword,
each shrieks in disharmony with his blade,
each joins the chorus of Chaos, a promise
of worse than death for those that hear it.
Beneath their feet the earth writhes at
their touch, as if seeking to escape
their presence.

Behold, a Daemon Lord comes, and we
are doomed...

And to tell of his Beast:
the like of it has never been
seen. He came upon a
mighty steed of groaning
iron and brazen steel, a
thing of living metal that
stood taller than a man and
roared with all the furies of
a thousand dead. He sat
securely proud in a deep
saddle that grew out the
very back of this accursed
Beast, its high posts
framing a massive head,
part hound, part bull, part
the incarnate soul of bloody
hate. As it came toward us
we saw its thousand close-
riveted plates, forged in
dark fires and bound with
runes. Its breath was fear
and its every step a
thundering knell of doom.
As it bared its brazen, gore-
speckled fangs, we lost all
heart and turned, fleeing to
the safety of the night and
terrors still unseen.

As he took up the blade,
a despairing groan was
torn from deep inside
and anguish masked his
features. A single tear
fell and turned to ice
upon the gleaming steel.
The moment passed and
he straightene, thrusting
high the sword as if to
pierce the vaulted skies
above. And with his
scream of triumph he
was enslaved.

‘For seventeen long
centuries have I remained in
this blade, confined within
these metal walls. During all
of my imprisonment you are
the first I have seen who is 
worthy to bear me into
battle. Come, take my hilt,
and I will serve you in the
manner of my kind,
drawing blood of your
enemies, protecting you in
the midst of the fight,
bringing you safe home
again. Now draw me from
the scabbard and test the
fineness of my balance. See
how easily I swing, how my
keen edge cleaves the air. A
good choice, am I not?

‘Willingly you picked me
up. Your first mistake.
Willingly you drew me. Your
second mistake. I do not
allow my servants to make
three mistakes, foolish
mortal...’

Hear me, for I speak with the
wisdom of long study and the
knowledge of the hidden ages. It
has been said by some I see before
me that the Daemon can be
vanquished and overcome with the
power of our sorceries. Can you
belive it? Can you believe that
your puling, petty magics will
throw down this thing of Night,
this lordly servant of dread Chaos?
It is the fond foolish hope of babes
and dribbling ancients that their
weak cries can rule the world and
stand against cold-hearted Truth.
And there is no truth so cold nor
so dark as the true blade with
which the Daemon reasons.

Hear me, for I am not blinded by
the vanity of selfish eyes. Hear me,
and I shall tell of how the
Daemon is to be undone and cast
into the Void...

“I shall tell you of the Singular Histories and Lamentable Fates of the brothers von Gottlieb...
Look into the fire, gentles, for my words can paint pictures in the flames. Look deep, and
drift slowly on the heat...”

The old man closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair. His voice was soft and warm
in the candlelit gloom.

“Lothar and Johann von Gottlieb. Regard them, in their fine silks and soft leathers. They
crave power, glory, success and all that accompanies such - much as do other men. They
are ambitious, and in this they match their father, but of him I will speak no further; the
old Baron is not yet in his grave.

“Darkness in their hearts. They have listened, watched and learned, understanding little,
Slaanesh has promised Lothar pleasures beyond pleasure. Khorne has offered nothing,
but Johann demands nothing. He has already killed, and found it to his taste. See, now
the two hate each other! Brotherly love often turns to the deepest hate.

“And their hate drove them from home, into the bosom of the Chaos Powers. Did Johann
chase Lothar, seeking his blood? Or did he run from the decadent pleasures Lothar
sought in his company? It matters not. Each chose the steep and slippery path of Chaos,
hatred the first handhold, the loathing of a brother the first step. Now begins the scramble!
‘Such a short, easy climb,’ croons Slaanesh. ‘A true warrior has no fear,’ bellows Khorne!

“Their climb can end in but one of the two ways: the triumphant shriek, voiced from the throat
of a newly-birthed Daemon, or the gibbering of a once-man, a Chaos Spawn, wallowing
in the stench of its own failure, condemned by Fate and abandoned by Mercy. Which
fate is worse? Ah, now there is a question...”
%
“Johann von Gottlieb. Murderer, hater, willing servant of Khorne. His bloody road
led him deeper into Chaos. He was unwise when he first killed, and with each killing
his folly grew. Each death marked him as Khorne's own, each drop of blood raised
him in Khorne's sigth. But it was his last killing as a true man that marked him out:
Johann slaughtered one of Khorne's Champions.

“In that moment he bellowed his victory to the sky. The Champion's blood was for
Khorne. The Champion's armour, a suit of darkest metal, forged in some far smithy
of Chaos, was for Johann. In that moment, Johann's handhold was firm, his reach
was long enough for the climb ahead. And in that moment, the darkness within burst
free, and Johann was marked as the Blood God's servant. Two terrible curved horns,
like those of a ram, sprouted from his forehead.

“And what of the other Gottlieb? There are many roads to Chaos, and Lothar
galloped down his chosen path. Nothing was beyond him. No creature, man, woman
or child, living or dead, was safe from his depravity. His behaviour would have shamed
a Bretonnian.”

At the back of the room a young woman sniggered and leaned forward in her chair.
The old man sipped his wine and held up a finger. Questions died on the girl's lips.

“I will say no more of that. But, young lady, you also wish to know whether Lothar
was marked by Chaos. You want to know whether you could see the mark... as if that
proved his guilt. Lothar was tainted from the moment he began his climb towards the
power and pleasure of Slaanesh!

“His loyalty was hidden from casual eyes. It was his hands, my dear, his hands. Fools
wondered why Lothar always wore gloves, and pitied his rheumatic fingers. The creature
within had shown itself, and Lothar's long, clever fingers had become bestial claws.
The first mark of Slaanesh was made, and Lothar bore it with quiet and
misguided pride...
%
“Many are they who debauch themselves in the name of Slaanesh, and Lothar fell
in with one such sect. He rose rapidly in their councils, for his mind was apt to their
purposes. He was inventive and quick-witted, and he amused his friends with the
originality and vitality of his contributions to their ‘cause’.

“As Lothar climbed in secret stature his loyalty became obvious to even the most casual
observer. No longer were his hands his only mark. He bore the new stigmata in an
horrific fashion. His tongue had been persuasive. a seductive lure to the unwary whom
he used for his pleasure and cast aside. His tongue remained a snare, but no normal
man had such a twisting thing within his jaws. The lash of his tongue became
dangerous indeed!

“Lothar fled, the Witch-hunters at his heels, until he reached the Chaos Wastes. Already
a champion in the cause of Slaanesh, he turned and killed his pursuers and cursed
forever the lands of his birth. Free to wander and despoil, he embraced Slaanesh with
renewed vigour.”

The fire ruptured and flared as its resinous wood burned and popped. Horned and
winged shadows danced behind the old man as he continued the tale.

“Johann's way was ever upwards in the favour of Khorne. His ruthless course was
marked in blood and skulls; blood for his god, and skulls piled high on the battlefields
and harsh meadows of Chaos. Death had no rest with Johann's work!

“As thought and reason slipped away from him, Johann burned with hate for all
those too weak to take the warrior's path. It gnawed at his heart, and found expression
in the changes that time wrought on the once-man. There had been a young Johann,
proud of his looks; now there was Johann the Beast. His face had been handsome;
now it was the snarling muzzle of a hunting dog...

Servants of Khorne...

Stood from horizon to horizon, filling the air with their shrieks, gibbers and howls
of blood. Their battle banner strained in the coppery wind that blew across their
ranks. It was a banner of deepest, darkest red, with but a single rune and a legend
of simple devotion: Blood for the Blood God. At some secret signal all fell silent,
and then came a single shriek of dark and bloody loyalty, a pact of hate and death.
It echoed from leathered skins, and grew to shake the clouds. And far above the Daemon's ranks,
there was an answering roar of approval, torn from Khorne's brazen throat.

Servants of Slaanesh...

...by their incantations, conjurations and accursed crafts have seduced, depraved
and corrupted both Man and Beast, bringing them low in the sight of others.
Numberless are their enormities and horrid offences; heinous and wicked their
every action. Revelling in perversity and debasement, twisted in mind and body,
these insidious servitors of the Pleasure Lord take delight in all manner of
abominable and unclean deeds. The Slaaneshi spread the depravity of Chaos to the unwary and
uncaring with heretical crimes and disobediences that cry out against nature and the true order
of the world.

Amassed on the field of battle, the electric colours of their contorted forms offend the eye as their
diseased lewdness offends the mind. Half-bared torsos of pink and blue boast of unreined lust;
others display limbs of glistening greens and yellows - pale shades of corruption which belle the
darkness they hide inside. They have abandoned the last vestige of true decency and sacrificed
their Humanity to serve the Dark Power of the Master of Carnal Joys and spread his corruption
among the innocent...

The black-headed axe

blade was a single rune,
an unforgiving skull

The grim weapon lifted,

deep-etched skull.

The Drifting Castle

The sky above grew darker than the blackest storm and a cold
wind blew. There was no rain but a shower of mortar dust, yellowed
leaves and tatters of flags.

No storm was in the sky, but a castle much as might be found
in any mortal land. Often had I imagined clouds to be trees and
fish and mountains, and now a foible of some nameless and
uncaring power had given this fortress the guise of a cloud. It
was an island torn from the land, drifting as the mist on a breeze,
yet solid and firm. In all that I had seen, this was as strange as
any of my visions.

The castle was an empty as any ruin. Like an animal stuffed and
mounted under glass, or a fish salted in a barrel, it had been
preserved and pickled by the whim of Chaos. Cast aside, and left
to wander across the heavens, all was still and desolate in that
place. Its towers no longer knew the sounds of men, its halls held
no lofty nobles, its gates admitted no tenantry, no sentinel stood
guard, no porter waited by the gate. Even the carrion birds, sole
visitors to its sad portals, had enjoyed their fill of the
dwellers' hospitality.

The shadow of the castle fell across my eyes, and I could see
no more.

The Inevitable City

The City was built of dark madness, and it stretched across the
land to fill me with dread, for the path I trod would bring me
to its portal. The City stones had been quarried from the night
and in all their details and dressings they celebrated wickedness.
No rain could wash the dust of evil from that place and no wind
could drive out its corrupt air. Insanity had served as architect,
engineer and master to the City's masons, had guided all
their levels and plumblines.

I turned my steps towards the far horizon, and still the City was
before me. Once more I turned, and again, and yet another
turning. With each freshly chosen course I drew nearer to the
City gates, and its towers and walls loomed higher. The fateful
gateway was the end of every road, and despair gnawed at my heart.

As I paused to seek a new escape, I saw that I was not alone on
the inevitable, hideous path. Between myself and the City stood
a man, his head bent and his eyes downcast, lost in some deep
contemplation. As I watched, he turned towards the City. His
strides were firm, but he came no closer to the gates until he
vanished in the distant mists.

Thus was it possible to avoid the City and its brooding darkness,
and I resolved to march, against all reason, to the City. And when
I did so, the City grew no closer, but was soon lost to my sigth...

The Marcher Fortress

There, the lands of Slaanesh stretched out below it, was a Fortress
of whimsies and foibles. It was an unlovely thing, stained by war
and victory. Its towers, higher than any palace, wounded the sky.
Its gateways were gaping maws that could swallow and vomit forth
whole armies. Its walls were darkened stone, veined in unnatural
colours and streaked with rotted lime and mortar. Here, at the
Marches of Slaanesh, was the Fortress, a sign of sovereignty, hated
and condemned by Khorne's bloody-handed worshippers.

Before the Fortress gates stretched a forest o death. From the
walls to the near horizon was the dismal wrack of battle: corpses,
the rusted swords and armour of the fallen, the standards of
Slaanesh and Khorne, all abandoned and forgotten long
centuries ago.

The graves of the fallen had become a rich loam, sucked upon
by the trees of a dark forest. Pierced by tree roots, the dead had
stirred once more, and each branch bore a skull, mildewed and
pregnant with loathing, a macabre and cruel cargo. Only the
ceaseless, horrendous laughter of the trapped shades disturbed
the field. Their fleshless jaws clattered in the still air; the only
reply the creaking of a windmill's sails and the grinding of
its stones.

For in the shadow of the castle a windmill turned, its sails moving
in the still air, and their unclean breeze stirred the tattered flags
of the dead. Within, the grindstones shuddered and groaned, while
between, pinioned and crushed, were the living corpses of the
fallen, ground to make a rich mortar of blood and bone, sinew
and brains. Thus was the Fortress maintained and strengthened,
its walls held aloft and marked by the power of mortality. Thus
was the field before it harvested.

And in the castle's mighty halls, its Daemon overlords feasted
and broke bread, in conscious parody of Man's small amenities.
All this I saw in an instant, and then my vision was swept
onwards...

The sword of the Knight of
Chaos was placed upon the
anvil, and the smith rained
many mighty blows upon it,
and yet no mark did show
upon the blade. It was thrust
into the heart of the furnace,
and when it was brought
forth, the smith did not smite
the blade once more with all
the skill of his craft, now
upon the edge, and still no
mark did show upon the blade.
My scribe did chance to prick
himself upon his small knife,
and but a single drop of blood
fell on the anvil, onto the
cursed blade thet lay there. At
this a great rune shone forth,
redder than the heart's blood,
and darker than night. The
evil sword did pulse and sing
upon the anvil, and all fled in
fear of the dire thing.

Their baying chills the heart and spreads icy
tendrils of fear through weak mortal sols.
And yet worse, yet more terrible to behold, are
the huntsmen of this fell pack. Following
close upon the Hounds, urging them ever
forward, come deformed beings, running and
shrieking, shrieking and running, driven by
the stateless bloodlust of their kind. With
twisted crimson frames they speed across the
blighted land, crouched over as if the better to
track the terror-spoor of their prey. Masters of
the Hunt, they seek the blood of Man to offer
at the foot of the Skull Throne, ever hungry
for fresh prey, ever willing to tear the warm
red flesh with their talons and to smear the
gore triumphant upon their curving horns.

Where the Daemons
treads, there treads
the weakling after.
Where stalks the

I say you can find
out the servants of

them by their Mark.
For believe me, each
bears a Mark, each
bears an outward
scar of the devilry
within. No man is
born so unnatural
that his body does
not revolt at the
foul pollution
spawned inside.

And by these Marks
can you tell them.
By the horns of the
beast - for they have
turned themselves
from the light and
should be
slaughtered like the
kine in the fields. By
the scales of the
snake - for they
slither in dark places
and should be beaten
with a rod. By the
feathers of the eagle
- for they have vexed
the gods with vain
flight and should
be brought down
with a stone...

With a mighty
shout he rose,
brighter than the
sun and more
fierce. In his hand
he held a rod of
twisted bone,
crossed and
double-crossed to
form the sign of
his dark lord, a
symbol of his
power and fruit of
mortal longings
well-fulfilled.

He rose above the
company, taller far
than they, and
looked with black
pride on these his
frighted slaves. He
snarled and heard
the sound of noble
hatred echoing
from the skies. He
stared the savage
stare of immortal
fury and death
was in his gaze.

And on that
blasted heath his
ashen servants
turned, gripped by
cold unthinking
terror, and fled his
presence. And on
the blasted heath
a Daemon Prince
was born.
