Hear me, for I speak with the
wisdom of long study and the
knowledge of the hidden ages. It
has been said by some I see before
me that the Daemon can be
vanquished and overcome with the
power of our sorceries. Can you
belive it? Can you believe that
your puling, petty magics will
throw down this thing of Night,
this lordly servant of dread Chaos?
It is the fond foolish hope of babes
and dribbling ancients that their
weak cries can rule the world and
stand against cold-hearted Truth.
And there is no truth so cold nor
so dark as the true blade with
which the Daemon reasons.

Hear me, for I am not blinded by
the vanity of selfish eyes. Hear me,
and I shall tell of how the
Daemon is to be undone and cast
into the Voidâ€¦
