Where one Daemon may
flatter and ensnare, a
Daemon of Khorne’s
blackened and wicked
persuasion lies only so that it
may sharpen the sacrificial
knife. And such and action
happens in the wink of an eye.

Where the Daemons
treads, there treads
the weakling after.
Where stalks the
dark hunter of the
night, creeps behind
the craven fool.

I say you can find
out the servants of
darkness and tell
them by their Mark.
For believe me, each
bears a Mark, each
bears an outward
scar of the devilry
within. No man is
born so unnatural
that his body does
not revolt at the
foul pollution
spawned inside.

And by these Marks
can you tell them.
By the horns of the
beast - for they have
turned themselves
from the light and
should be
slaughtered like the
kine in the fields. By
the scales of the
snake - for they
slither in dark places
and should be beaten
with a rod. By the
feathers of the eagle
- for they have vexed
the gods with vain
flight and should
be brought down
with a stone…

With a mighty
shout he rose,
brighter than the
sun and more
fierce. In his hand
he held a rod of
twisted bone,
crossed and
double-crossed to
form the sign of
his dark lord, a
symbol of his
power and fruit of
mortal longings
well-fulfilled.

He rose above the
company, taller far
than they, and
looked with black
pride on these his
frighted slaves. He
snarled and heard
the sound of noble
hatred echoing
from the skies. He
stared the savage
stare of immortal
fury and death
was in his gaze.

And on that
blasted heath his
ashen servants
turned, gripped by
cold unthinking
terror, and fled his
presence. And on
the blasted heath
a Daemon Prince
was born.
