We beseech thee, destroy them.

'Never before or since have I seen fighting such as I witnessed when that host fell upon the Orks.
Seizing the moment, I regrouped my Company and led them once more into the fray, yet there was
little work for us, for the greenskins lacked stomach for the fight. Soon we secured the great
bastion once more and without further loss. Of the dark brotherhood there was no sign.'

“Some called him a monster, a madman. Indeed the line between ecstatic determination and insane ruthlessness is vague
and wavering. It is true that he ordered the bombardment of worlds until they submitted. It is also true that he
would have driven his men into the jaws of death for all eternity had they not finally grown weary. It is true that he
would sometimes order the butchering of whole worlds that opposed his force. But this was not all that he was. He was
magnanimous in victory and many were the times he spared a world that had impressed him with its courage and resolve.
He was a deeply spiritual men too, driven ever onwards for the greater glory of the Emperor, not only his own fame. He
was consumed by his desires, a passionate man who was willing to pay any price to fulfil his dreams of conquest. The
Imperium needed such a man at that time, as it stood on the threshold of greatness once again. The Apostasies had passed,
the Treaty of Ceres had reunited Earth and Mars once again and the Conclave of Mount Amalath was witness to such
great promises. He was the man to fulfil those promises, to stretch out the Emperor's grasp once more. It was he who
dragged the reborn Imperium through the fires of battle, screaming a new birth cry as its golden age came about, the
zenith of Mankind's power. Without him, who is to say what might not have come to pass, what doubts would have been
seeded in the heart of the Imperium once more. No-one can dare say they think of him without humble gratitude for the
marvels he performed. Many men have been dubbed insane for putting into practice what many Saints have preached. Solar
Macharius was such a man.”

'We have crossed the Sea
of Stars in the name of the
Allfather and the Wolf-King.
These voyages were a time
for camaraderie, a time for
meditation, a time to prepare
for glories to come. But we are
at voyage's end, my brothers,
and now shall our warrior
fury be unleashed.'
