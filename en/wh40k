And what are the achievements of
your fragile Imperium? It is a corpse
rotting slowly from within while
maggots writhe in its belly. It was
built with the toil of heroes and
giants, and now it is inhabited by
frightened weaklings to whom the
glories of those times are halt-
forgotten legends. I have forgotten
nothing, and my wisdom has expanded
far beyond mere mortal frailties.

Every segmentum, indeed almost every
sector of the Imperium, has a Cypher
legend, some of them dating back
thousands of years, and the number of
bounties offered for his capture would
buy a subsector were anyone able to
collect them. It is clear that the
popularity of Cypher legends is tied to
nonconformists throughout the Imperium.
Self-deluded radicals believe that
Imperial institutions attempt to repress
individuality and, in a perverse reaction,
subconsciously approve of the maverick
mystery man.

Cypher has become an iconic figure in
the minds of these neurotic radicals. He
is hooded, clearly implying that he is an
outlaw who wishes to avoid recognition,
a pointless gesture because everyone
clearly does recognize him! In fact, most
sightings are only the result of an
imaginative observer conferring Cypher's
identity on some unknown man. Anyone
who foments rebellion and defies capture
can become Cypher in the popular
imagination. Tales commonly emphasize
Cypher's prodigious skill with pistols:
normally he is portrayed firing both a
plasma pistol and a bolt pistol with
unerring accuracy. This technique is
normally associated with hive gangers,
particularly outlaws of the sort that
attract a mystique similare to that of
Cypher. Such “sightings” are clearly a
product of uncontrolled wish fulfillment
rather than accurate observation. Finally
and most perplexing are the frequent
references to the sword that Cypher
carries. There are no credible examples
of the sword being drawn. However, the
rumour most commonly heard is that the
sword is broken and is somehow
connected to the early history of the
Dark Angels. The link with the Dark
Angels is a difficult one to prove, as
they are among the most secretive of
the Adeptus Astartes. It is known that
the Dark Angels and their successor
Chapters sometimes refer to themselves
collectively as the Unforgiven and are
frequently seen hunting down renegade
and traitor Space Marines with or
without official sanction. It is assumed
by some, therefore, that Cypher is a
former Dark Angel and that his sword
may be one of their sacred relics. This
is pure supposition and an insult to the
reputation of the Emperor's most
devoted warriors.

Follow me, my children, and the
glory of victory shall be yours.
We shall cleanse ourselves in the
crimson waters of the enemy. We
shall bring the ecstasy of quick
release to those who stand before
us. We shall give bloody praise to
the Lord of Pleasure and sing his
name as we dance across the
fallen. Follow me my children,
and you shall taste the undreamt
joys that lie beyond the bounds
of mortal sense.

Logan Grimnar,
Bloody-handed warrior,
He piles the skulls of his enemies.
He builds a mound of the fallen.
His foes weep rivers of woe.

Logan Grimnar,
The strong wolf of the pack,
His sword hungers for red flesh.
His guns thirst for battle.
He laughs amidst the blattle-din.
Logan Grimnar, father of wolves,
His sons hunt his enemies,
Slay them where they falter,
And bring their pelts to Fenris.

'Never before or since have I seen fighting such as I witnessed when that host fell upon the Orks.
Seizing the moment, I regrouped my Company and led them once more into the fray, yet there was
little work for us, for the greenskins lacked stomach for the fight. Soon we secured the great
bastion once more and without further loss. Of the dark brotherhood there was no sign.'

“Some called him a monster, a madman. Indeed the line between ecstatic determination and insane ruthlessness is vague
and wavering. It is true that he ordered the bombardment of worlds until they submitted. It is also true that he
would have driven his men into the jaws of death for all eternity had they not finally grown weary. It is true that he
would sometimes order the butchering of whole worlds that opposed his force. But this was not all that he was. He was
magnanimous in victory and many were the times he spared a world that had impressed him with its courage and resolve.
He was a deeply spiritual men too, driven ever onwards for the greater glory of the Emperor, not only his own fame. He
was consumed by his desires, a passionate man who was willing to pay any price to fulfil his dreams of conquest. The
Imperium needed such a man at that time, as it stood on the threshold of greatness once again. The Apostasies had passed,
the Treaty of Ceres had reunited Earth and Mars once again and the Conclave of Mount Amalath was witness to such
great promises. He was the man to fulfil those promises, to stretch out the Emperor's grasp once more. It was he who
dragged the reborn Imperium through the fires of battle, screaming a new birth cry as its golden age came about, the
zenith of Mankind's power. Without him, who is to say what might not have come to pass, what doubts would have been
seeded in the heart of the Imperium once more. No-one can dare say they think of him without humble gratitude for the
marvels he performed. Many men have been dubbed insane for putting into practice what many Saints have preached. Solar
Macharius was such a man.”
