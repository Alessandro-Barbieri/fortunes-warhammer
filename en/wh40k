“A battle is but one part of a larger whole. Any student of
war will tell you that a wise commander will not commit
to battle unless he has first ensured that it is a fight he
cannot lose. But this still gives the battle an importance it
does not warrant. Fighting a battle, even a battle you
cannot fail to win, is the purest foolishness unless it
advances the chances of ending the need for any further
battles. Your primary aim must always be to win the war,
not win the battle.”

Abrom clutched the worn, metal
casing of the autogun closer to
his chest as the first missiles began
to fall. All around him the other
members of the coven hunched into
the rubble and whispered prayers to
the Patterner, He Who Wields Fate.
The barrage thundered closer and
they chanted louder and more
fervently, to drown out the shrieks
of those blown apart by that deadly
hail.

Ahash vri Arvad Abi-ba’al Aduni-
ba’al, Sapari ba’al…

Abrom could not understand why
they were suffering so. Had not the
Servant of the Patterner promised
that its awesome powers would
drive back the denizens of the False
Emperor? Had it not sworn that
the uprising would be an
unstoppable force, a swinging
hammer which would smash apart
the shackles of the Dead Emperor
which bound them into slavery? If
this pounding continued there would
be no one left alive to liberate.

As if in answer to Abrom’s prayers,
the explosions abruptly ceased.
Stones and shrapnel thrown up by
the bombardment hissed to the
ground for a second ot two before
an eerie silence fell. Abrom
cautiously peered out of his hiding
place and into the clouds of smoke
drifting over the ruins of the
settlement. There! A flash of red in
the haze, and another! Giant, red-
armoured figures stalked forward
across the shattered landscape like
primordial beasts.

Abrom felt a shudder down his
spine - the blood suckers were here,
sniffing out survivors to rip apart
with their bare hands and drain
their blood. Abrom gripped his
autogun more tightly as their leader,
Boreaus the Demagogue, gestured
his surviving companions forward.
They all knew they could expect no
mercy from the blood suckers, and
less from the Servant of the
Patterner if they lost faith now.

Merkin was blown
apart by an explosive
bolt as soon as he
stood up to shoot.
Then Jaynak and Veril,
and three others who
Abrom didn’t know
suffered the same fate.

Malakur was lucky and
only had his arm blown off, but
his screaming ceased in seconds as
his life-blood gushed out onto the
dusty rubble.

Abrom and the others were
splattered with blood and viscera
and flying stone fragments as more
bolts roared across the position.
Abrom felt the urge to run (if only
he could make his legs break the
shackles of fear which bound them).
Boreaus tried to rally them, chanting
the prayer the Servant had taught
them until his voice was cracked
and hoarse.

Budi-ba’al, Ba’al-iashupu, Ba’al
maluku!

As Boreaus chanted, Abrom felt a
tingling thrill through him, a
change seemed to be taking place.
Boreaus’ words became shrieks as
his spine twisted back and limbs
splayed apart. Blue fire spilled from
his jaws as they stretched out to an
impossible length. His skin split as
something far too big unfolded
itself from within him. Scintillating
feathered wings shook themselves
outward, glittering like jewels as the
Servant of the Patterner raised its
slender body up to twice man-
heigth. Abrom averted his gaze and
grovelled as its ancient, inhuman
eyes swept over the coven and out
to where the blood suckers
approached, unflinching as a storm
of bolter fire roared past. It spoke
with a rich, melodious voice.

“Come childrennn, your time is
nigh…”

With a beat of its mighty pinions,
the awesome presence was gone.
Abrom and the others surged
forward after it, their terrified
voices howling a song of praise to
the Lord of Change.

At the end of the 41ˢᵗ millennium the runic readings of the Farseers were
brimming with dire portents. Eldrad Ulthran’s worst suspicions were
confirmed when Maugan Ra strode through the Craftworld’s main webway
portal, accompanied by a massive bodyguard of Dark Reapers. The presence
of the Phoenix Lord on Ulthwé affirmed the fact that the Craftworld was
in great peril. Before the hour was out, the Seer Council and Maugan Ra
began a council of war.

Behind the closed doors of the Spirit Chambers, the Farseers vainly probed
the skeins of probability for a safe path through the coming storm. The
sheer scale of the coming conflict was terrifying: the forces of the Mon-
keigh and the minions of Chaos outnumbered the Eldar by millions to one.
There was only one way Eldrad could feasibly alter the course of fate in so
many theatres of such an apocalyptic war.

Whilst the Avatar of Ulthwé was awoken and the Spear of Khaine
assembled to march with him to war. Eldrad fragmented his consciousness,
storing a piece of his psyche in hundreds of sacred Waystones. Maugan
Ra assembled the Black Guardians of Ulthwé, dividing them into small
Strike Forces capable of travelling the convoluted labyrinth of the webway.
With the leader of each detachment carrying a sacred Waystone. Eldrad
could disperse his consciousness across the entire sector, guiding each
Strike Force through the webway to the heart of each battle at exactly
the right time and location. Maugan Ra’s Dark Reaper bodyguard added
to the strength of the Black Guardians in each Strike Force, and every
member of the Craftworld who could don the mask of the Warlock did
so to better lead their brethren.

When the storm broke, Ulthwé was ready to strike like the lightning.

Brother Sergeant Egil of the Space Wolves
ducked behind the smoking, burnt out shell of
a Land Raider and slammed a fresh magazine
into his bolter. The remains of his Blood Claw
pack were spread throughout the blasted
building, gore streaked and exhausted. Even with
the filtering effect of his armour’s auto senses,
the noise of the battle was still deafening. He
risked a glance around the side of the Land
Raider. Thick clouds of choking black ash fell
from a lacerated sky, and the entire city was
aflame. Massive explosions and the thunder of
artillery obscured the battle and rendered even
his acute senses useless. Egil spun roud, raising
his bolter to a firing position as he heard the
crunch of heavy footsteps approaching behind
him. The massive Terminator armoured form of
Brother Kaarlson of the Wolf Guard entered
the building and Egil lowered his gun.

“Ready your men, sergeant. We take the fight to
the traitors.” snarled the Wolf Guard. Even over
the vox-com’s distortion and din of battle, the
edge of feral anticipation in Kaarlson’s voice was
unmistakable. Egil nodded, passing the word to
his men. The green runes on his visor display
blinked as the Space Wolves acknowledged his
orders. Egil racked the slide on his bolter as
the ground suddenly shook under a thunderous
impact. The deep, rumbling crash sounded again,
like an angry gos’s footsteps, and Egil looked
up as a massive shadow swallowed them.
Emerging from the smoke, like a vast beast
from the sagas, a Night Gaunt Titan towered
above them, its dark carapace silhouetted against
the bloody sky.

Lights flared around the Titan’s head as Imperial
fire impacted on its void shields, but the
enormous machine ignored them, lifting one
huge leg ponderously from the ground. Egil
could clearly hear the whine of its powerful
actuators over the explosions. The gigantic war
machine’s foot smashed aside buildings in its
path and Egil realised with sick horror exactly
where it would stamp down.

“Everybody up! Move!” he yelled and fired his
jump pack as the shadow of the Titan’s foot
descended upon them. Egil powered through the
air, heedless of the crack of small arms fire
that burst around him, angling for the cover of
a shattered bunker. He landed badly and cursed
as he fell in the rubble, looking back to see
Kaarlson slowly lumbering though the ruins.
He screamed his name as the mass of the
Titan’s foot smashed through the building and
crashed down upon the Wolf Guard Terminator.
Egil covered his head as the Titan’s other foot
swept above him, showering dust and debris.
Howling with rage, he fired his bolter
ineffectually at the Titan as it strode onwards,
unheeding of the great warrior it had just
killed.

Egil again reloaded his weapon, his thoughts
filled with avenging the fallen Kaarlson. He
looked over towards the flattened building and
watched with astonishment as the rubble began
to shift and heave. Massive chunks of plascrete
and steel were pushed aside as Kaarlson pulled
himself free of the debris. His Terminator
armour had been gashed open in a dozen
different places and his blood was splashed
crimson against its grey, but he was alive.

The Wolf Guard Terminator joined Egil in the
ruins of the bunker and shouted. “Like I said,
Sergeant. Ready your men. We’ve wasted enough
time already. We have a battle to win!”

Corporal Deakins gripped the stock of his lasgun and tried in vain to
stop himself from being jolted against the interior of the Chimera
armoured troop carrier. The transport bounced over another ridge of
frozen ground, sending his helmeted head slamming into a metal
stanchion. He swore and cursed the driver of the transport. Rivers of
melted snow pooled around his combat boots, sloshing about as the
squad was carried across the hard packed ground. He looked around
the compartment at the excited faces of 2nd Squad as they fired the
hull lasguns. Sergeant Kobal was sitting at the back of the Chimera,
seemingly untroubled by the jarring ride. His eyes were half shut,
headphones pressed to his hear as he concentrated on hearing the vox-
chatter over the deafening howl of the Chimera’s powerful engine.

“Right lads!” bellowed Kobal, his voice easily cutting throug the
engine noise. “On your feet and get ready for disembarkation!”

Deakins could hear the engine noise deepen and the storm bolter open
fire as the Chimera slowed to a speed that would allow them to
safely dismount. With a squeal of hydraulics, the Chimera’s back ramp
began to drop. By the Emperor he was looking forward to this! He
could feel his heart rate thud like a trip-hammer, his earlier
discomfort and annoyance fading as he saw dozens of Chimera behind
theirs slowing and deploying from column into line.

“Go! Go! Go!” shouted Kobal even before the ramp was fully lowered.
As one, the ten man squad pounded down the ramp, jumping to the
muddy snow that formed their wake. Quickly looking around he could
see thousands of other troops pouring from their transports and a
fierce pride swelled in his breast.

Corpses bloated with noxious gases spewed
excremental fluids as the filth encrusted
Land Raider crushed them beneath its rusted
iron tracks, grinding their jellied bones to
pulp. Explosions burst around the massive
vehicle, filling the air with lethal fragments
and scoring the necrotic surface of its
armoured hide. Hulking and deformed
warriors kept pace with the plague tank, firing
mucus covered bolters through the yellow fog
as they advanced. The Imperial Fists defensive
line was less than fifty metres away, the
ground before it littered with the twisted,
plague-ridden carcasses of those unfortunate
enough to have been touched by the dark
powers.

The fog coiled about the Land Raider like a
living thing, as though it moved on some vile
business of its own. The white heat of
lascannon fire speared through the sickly haze
and struck the hull of the tank, blasting a
deep woud in its fleshy exterior. The
massive vehicle slewed around, but kept
moving, spinning tracks churning scraps of
rotten flesh and decayed limbs as it rumbled
over the pathetic barricade their foes had
erected. The ground shook as the vehicle
crashed back to earth. The front ramp
dropped and pestilential fumes gusted from
within, like the breath of some vast, infected
beast. Vomited from the belly of the
armoured beast, warriors spawned in a
festering nightmare charged from the Land
Raider, a foul miasma of contagion wreathing
their helmets in smoky darkness. Almost
three metres tall, the huge figures wore
poisonous green suits of Terminator armour,
splashed with clusters of weeping boils and
sores. Diseased lesions and foul organic matter
oozed from cracks in the armour, the stench
of the plague Terminators causing even the
defending Space Marines to gag through their
re-breather equipment.

Captain Learchus of the Imperial Fists
levelled his bolter at the hideous giants before
him, scarce able to believe that he would once
have called these abominations brothers. Their
souls were forfeit to the dark gods and their
inner corruption was manifest in their
hideousness. Hatred like nothing he had
known before coursed through his veins like
an electric charge as he emptied his magazine
into the traitors. His squad followed
his example, firing without pause into
the charging Terminators. Several shells found
homes in traitor flesh, blasting chunks
of diseased tissue and ceramite clear, but
not a single Terminator fell, the decaying
armour and unnatural resilience of the
followers of Nurgle carrying them through
the hail of fire.

                *     *     *

Brother Colathrax stalked leisurely through
the fog of sweet corruption and hail of bolter
shells, his plague sword licking out left and
right. He cut and stabbed, slicing skin and
pricking organs, but never killing outrigth; no,
never that. For whi was he to deprive his foes
of the agonising bliss of Father’s Nurgle Rot?
How sweet it was to watch those whom the
false Emperor had made mighty descend into
madness and decay, their once powerful
bodies turning on them as plague reduced
them to mindless, gibbering horrors of
mutated flesh. They had set themselves up as
gods and would now pay the price for that
arrogance. A Space Marine Captain in blazing
yellow armour stood before him, his sword
raised in challenge and Colathrax smiled.

“Time to die, traitor!” hissed Captain
Learchus.
Colathrax chuckled, “I think not.” and swung
his dripping sword at his opponent. Learchus
ducked and thrust with his own weapon. The
energised edge scraped a furrow in the
Terminator’s armour, but slid clear. Colathrax
batted aside his opponent’s blade with his
power fist, stabbing his suppurating weapon
through Learchus’ belly. The blade of the
plague sword skewered the Space Marine in
an upward arc, lifting him from his feet and
hammering through the building behind.

Learchus hung suspended above the ground,
blood pooling beneath his twitching body.
The wound refused to close and Learchus
coughed bloody phlegm as he felt the meat
of his body rotting at a terrifying rate,
internal organs flooding with dead fluids and
the flesh of his limbs sloughing from his
bones inside his armour. His breath rasped as
his lungs dissolved and his vision faded as shis
eyeballs liquefied, sliding down his face like
glutinous tears. He tried to curse his killer,
nut his throat had ruptured and seconds later
his brain was a foetid grey ooze dribbling
from his sagging head.

Brother Colathrax inhaled the intoxicating
aroma of his master’s putrescent benediction
and offered a short prayer to Father Nurgle.
He wrenched his sword from the wall,
allowing the sloshing suit of power armour to
topple to the stinking ground. The
disintegration of this world was almost
complete and Colathrax could taste their
victory on the foul wind that swept the
battlefield. He pictured oceans of decaying
flesh, infection rampant and plagues
unnumbered. That would be their gift to the
denizens of this mortal realm.

Colathrax laughed at the thought as the fog
closed in.

+++Director, Division Ocular - EYES ONLY

The following are my personal comments to your Lordship only, Overall, while the sheer zeal of this new cult can feel disturbing at first, I
see little cause for worry. As noted above, they have high marks from the regional governor of their originating province - several of the
higher ranking officials are openly strong members of the cult, but continue of course to be loyal to your Lordship. Their basic tenets do
not conflict with the Imperial Creed, though several members of the Ministorum locally have differing opinions on that matter as I’m sure
your Lordship is aware.

This ‘Brotherhood of the Faithful’ preach honest toil, respect for elders, humility, and self-reliance. I was allowed to visit one of their
countryside retreats, and observed the membership in action. All were very properly subservient to me as a recognised agent of your
Lordship, and no attempt was made to hide or conceal anything. I also viewed several church services, and while there were not enough
specific praises to the Emperor of Man for my personal tastes, their more general call to serve the ‘All-Father’ were plentiful and
enthusiastic. When queried, I was told this was the overall name they used in their faith for the Emperor or even your Lordship. They feel
strongly in following the single leading figure in the culture evidently.

Many of the ranking officials wanted to press upon their dedication to your Lordship; I got the feeling they were worried they might be
targeted as heretics. During my meeting with Brother Barantom the young leader of the movement (see transcript above), I got the same
feeling, but more of a confident tone of the fundamental and righteous nature of his faith. Very well spoken, as well as strongly
charismatic fellow. This undercurrent of absolute and utter conviction is one of the things that has made this group grow so well in my
opinion. As noted above, it started out some years ago as an odd cult of re-birth and renewal though faith, represented by the ‘snake
swallowing its own tail’ symbol. [Again, I’m still not sure exactly how long ago; some archived records we have contains clues indicating
this could be an offshoot of an even older religious following dating back several decades at least] Some of the older members still cling to
those older beliefs I would imagine, but has done much better since moving towards a more mainstream belief system.

Quite honestly, I think the main reason the Ministorum is so upset with this group is that they are simply becoming too popular, especially
in the more remote areas away from the capitol. Since they follow the Imperial Creed, they cannot launch an overt attack on the group
though. Thus my official recommendation for continued intensive monitoring and possible infiltration, so we can keep them satisfied by
appearing to be closely watching the situation. But privately, I would recommend your Lordship not waste any more resources than the
bare minimum. This ‘Brotherhood’ is just a passing fancy of the masses, and will fade on its own soon enough with time.

“Diverse and many-fold weaponry is of the

worthless. On another world, the armoured
abominations of the alien Eldar may be

The commander must maintain the watchful
gaze of the eagle to seek his foes through
scope and slit. Once found, they must be
crushed with the full weight of fire before
seeking the next enemy, for the beast
which is merely maimed may strike back…
still. When a suitable target is found, the
machine must be halted for most

Every segmentum, indeed almost every
sector of the Imperium, has a Cypher
legend, some of them dating back
thousands of years, and the number of
bounties offered for his capture would
buy a subsector were anyone able to
collect them. It is clear that the
popularity of Cypher legends is tied to
nonconformists throughout the Imperium.
Self-deluded radicals believe that
Imperial institutions attempt to repress
individuality and, in a perverse reaction,
subconsciously approve of the maverick
mystery man.

Cypher has become an iconic figure in
the minds of these neurotic radicals. He
is hooded, clearly implying that he is an
outlaw who wishes to avoid recognition,
a pointless gesture because everyone
clearly does recognize him! In fact, most
sightings are only the result of an
imaginative observer conferring Cypher’s
identity on some unknown man. Anyone
who foments rebellion and defies capture
can become Cypher in the popular
imagination. Tales commonly emphasize
Cypher’s prodigious skill with pistols:
normally he is portrayed firing both a
plasma pistol and a bolt pistol with
unerring accuracy. This technique is
normally associated with hive gangers,
particularly outlaws of the sort that
attract a mystique similar to that of
Cypher. Such “sightings” are clearly a
product of uncontrolled wish fulfillment
rather than accurate observation. Finally
and most perplexing are the frequent
references to the sword that Cypher
carries. There are no credible examples
of the sword being drawn. However, the
rumour most commonly heard is that the
sword is broken and is somehow
connected to the early history of the
Dark Angels. The link with the Dark
Angels is a difficult one to prove, as
they are among the most secretive of
the Adeptus Astartes. It is known that
the Dark Angels and their successor
Chapters sometimes refer to themselves
collectively as the Unforgiven and are
frequently seen hunting down renegade
and traitor Space Marines with or
without official sanction. It is assumed
by some, therefore, that Cypher is a
former Dark Angel and that his sword
may be one of their sacred relics. This
is pure supposition and an insult to the
reputation of the Emperor’s most
devoted warriors.

INQUISITOR THRAX…
…cleared his throat and dictated the last section of his report.

“The mutants have been eradicated throughout the Chapter. The tainted officers
have been slain. The Chapter Master chose to take his own life rather than face
his deserved fate. The creatures he summoned have been banished, or have
returned to the Warp. From past experience, we know that the link, once broken, must needs be
established from our side of the warpgates.”

“That will not happen again in this place. My administration of
justice has made sure of that. The unfortunate lapses of the last
months have been cleansed. Full casualty reports are attached.”

“I can now confidently claim that, under their new - and morally
pure - corps of officers, the reformed Grey Slayers Chapter of
the Legiones Astartes will prove as loyal in future as they did
in the past.”

“Hail the Emperor!”

“Thrax, Inquisitor Ordinary, This day of etc etc… Make a good
copy and then return so that I may seal the despatch.”

“Yes, Lord Inquisitor.”

Thrax sat down at the former Chapter Master’s desk. He had a
mind to keep it for his own. The workmanship had a certain naive
charm. The inlay work was particularly fine for a backward world,
such intricate patterns, such a pleasing arrangement of woods
and techplastics. One could almost believe that it all meant
something. His finger idly traced across the surface, following
the line of a swirl and loop…

In Warpspace something stirred. Its name had almost been used.
Soon the Word would be used, and the Way opened. The
summoning was happening. It could feel the drawing together
of power and intent…

Thrax was thinking hard, and now his finger barely moved. The
Chapter Master had been weak, a fool. But the power he had
tapped! Properly used, in the service of the Emperor, could it
not make him the best, the greatest, of all the Inquisitors? His
finger moved across the desktop again, following the inlay…

Soon… Soon…

Thrax reached the end of the techplastic line. He half-turned
towards something in the corner of his eye. And the he knew…

NOW!

There was a knock on the door. The scribe had returned.
“Inquisitor Thrax, I have the copy of your report, Lord.” His
voice filled with doubt. “Inquisitor… Thrax? My Lord?”

In a rush of mandibles and heaving flesh, Inquisitor Thrax feasted.

It had once been an occupied position.
The gun emplacement had protected thirty of
the Eldar’s dark kin, but now resembled
nothing so much as an abattoir. Shredded
Eldar corpses lay strewn around, torn to pieces
by an hour long bombardment from the
Ultramarine’s Whirlwinds nearly a thousand
metres away. The fortifications were pock-
marked with shrapnel hits, but were for all
intents and purposes intact. Captain Invictus
had vetoed the Imperial Guard Colonel’s plan
of shelling the position with Earthshaker
cannons, realising that when the Dark Eldar
counter-attacked, as he knew they would any
minute, the Imperial forces would need this
position. Four Space Marine Rhinos sped
across the snow and ground to a halt beside
the emplacement, the ceramite doors sliding
smoothly back along oiled runners. Warm air
from inside the vehicles condensed as the
winter’s chill rushed to fill the troop
compartments. With practised precision the
Space Marines disembarked from their vehicles,
the Devastators immediately taking up firing
positions. When the Dark Eldar attacked, they
would find the Space Marines ready and
waiting for them.

Lush green fields sped below the two skimming Saim-hann Falcon grav-tanks as
they hugged the contours of the land. Blurs of red and black, they smoothly
banked around a rocky outcrop and rose to crest a wooded ridge. Brigth sunlight
glittered from the barrels of the skimmers’ pulse lasers and shuriken cannons.
While their kin fought the Mon-keigh on the eastern plains, the Falcons circled
around the flanks to bring death from behind. Each carried a squad of Howling
Banshees, Aspect Warriors whose skill in close combat was beyond compare. The
Falcon pilots knew that the crude tanks of the Mon-keigh were manoeuvring in
an attempt to intercept them, but their tracked vehicles were far too slow and
clumsy. They would not be successful and the Eldar would triumph.

Most revered Prioress Helena (the Virtuous) of Convent Sanctorum,

My commendations go to your Sisters of the Order of the Valorous Heart in their
undertakings against the heretical infidels infesting Hive Tumulus on Farglum.
The Holy Order’s response to my request was most prompt, making planetfall less
than a week after my entreaty was directed to them.

The fury of their righteous anger was exemplary, and countless souls were returned to
the Emperor through the purifying fire of the weapons and strength of their
unyielding faith.

Through their actions, the hive was purged of its blasphemous perversions, and the so-called Cult
Epicurean was all but eradicated. The last few of its foul ‘prophets’ and apostates have fled deep within
the abyss of the underhive, where my companions and I pursue them still.

The holy fury displayed by the Canonness Brigitta and her Sisters was devastating to the unholy cultists.
An inspiration to behold! The terror they induced amongst the corrupted hivers caused a wave of devotion to
spread through the hive. Praise be to the Emperor! The sacred Order of the Virtuous Heart are a credit to the
Ecclesiarchy, and indeed to the Imperium as a whole.

Sergeant Curtis stabbed his bayonet
through the head of a Termagant, pulling
the trigger to blast its body clear. He
could hear an ominous rattling from
somewhere on the other side of the
defensive wall, but didn’t have time to
wonder what it might be as another
Termagant attempted to tear out his
throat. He shot the beast in the belly
and staggered as a massive impact
thundered into the compound’s exterior
wall. Man-killing chunks of plascrete
tumbled from the wall and Curtis
watched in horror as a massive,
segmented body pushed its snake-like
bulk over the smashed remnants of the
defences. It’s enormous forelimbs ended
in gigantic, razor claws, blazing coronas
of electrical energy arcing downwards
into the terrified Imperial Guardsmen,
burning them to death where they stood.

The vast monster reared up on its
bloated body, as though taking a deep
breath and the coruscating halo of blue
fire surrounding its claws began
expanding, growing brighter and more
intense. Curtis screamed a warning and
turned to run, but it was already too
late. A blinding geyser of blue-white
electrical flame erupted from between the
beast’s talons, fountaining through the
ranks of his terrified soldiers. Curtis ran
for his life, but the Trygon’s discharge
washed over him seconds later. The
electrical inferno instantly seared the
flesh from his bones, his blackened
skeleton running through the flames for
another two strides before finally
collapsing in a smoking pile of scorched
bones.

malice of a daemon that is dreaming, casting its shadow over
all we have ever done and all we ever shall. Every twisted strand
of Fate and casting of the Runes leads me to this time, to this
place, and it is clear that the final battle awaits me to this time, to this
Crone Worlds. A conflict the likes of which has not been seen
since the Mon-Keigh warred amongst themselves, and their corpse
of a seer fell to his traitorous son, is coming and all my steps lead
towards it, no matter that I walk other paths. I see the stars
stained red with the blood of the Mon-Keigh and, though their

Sister Aliesha sang lustily along with the devotional hymns
reverberating from the loudspeakera attached to the hull of the
Immolator tank as it neared the mob of men in the marble
flagged square. Thinking they had the holy shrine surrounded,
the rebel planetary defence troopers swarmed around the shrine
of Our Lady of the Perpetual Martyr. Their raucous cries were
drowned out by the singing of the charging Battle Sisters.
Squads of Seraphims descended from the armoured buttresses of
the vast cathedral, bolt pistols chattering a litany of death as the
explosive bolts impacted deep into unarmoured flesh.

One of the rebel troopers recognised the armament of the
Immolator as it rumbled steadily towards enemy lines. Shorn of
the long-range firepower of the Adeptus Astartes tanks, the
flamethrower tank required proximity to fulfil its role as
purifier of the heretics. Autogun fire ricocheted from the front
of the tank, and Aliesha heard a clank as the top hatch of the
Immolator was thrown open. Sister Bacharia swung her heavy
bolter out of the passenger compartment, sending a continual
stream of large calibre explosive bolts into the heretics assailing
the sides of the tank. They were close to surrounding her now.
At Aliesha's signal, Sister Bacharia ducked back inside and
closed the top hatch. Aliesha thumbed the button that fired up
the ignition flame of the Inferno cannon and flexed her
gauntleted fingers on the trigger mechanism. The holy fire of
her weapon, blessed this very morning by the Canoness, would
soon show these blasphemous fools the error of their ways.

“Some called him a monster, a madman. Indeed the line between ecstatic determination and insane ruthlessness is vague
and wavering. It is true that he ordered the bombardment of worlds until they submitted. It is also true that he
would have driven his men into the jaws of death for all eternity had they not finally grown weary. It is true that he
would sometimes order the butchering of whole worlds that opposed his force. But this was not all that he was. He was
magnanimous in victory and many were the times he spared a world that had impressed him with its courage and resolve.
He was a deeply spiritual men too, driven ever onwards for the greater glory of the Emperor, not only his own fame. He
was consumed by his desires, a passionate man who was willing to pay any price to fulfil his dreams of conquest. The
Imperium needed such a man at that time, as it stood on the threshold of greatness once again. The Apostasies had passed,
the Treaty of Ceres had reunited Earth and Mars once again and the Conclave of Mount Amalath was witness to such
great promises. He was the man to fulfil those promises, to stretch out the Emperor’s grasp once more. It was he who
dragged the reborn Imperium through the fires of battle, screaming a new birth cry as its golden age came about, the
zenith of Mankind’s power. Without him, who is to say what might not have come to pass, what doubts would have been
seeded in the heart of the Imperium once more. No-one can dare say they think of him without humble gratitude for the
marvels he performed. Many men have been dubbed insane for putting into practice what many Saints have preached. Solar

The beat of powerful wings, a sense of
dephtless sadness. That it should come to
this… comrades in arms locked in a battle to
the death. Then he saw him, his brother once,
his enemy now. Flashing blades and and
explosion of blood, screaming pain flaring
round his boby like an electric charge and he…

…opened his eyes, sweat coating his
skin with an oily sheen, his mouth
filled with blood. He swallowed and
ran his tongue over his teeth, fighting
back the visions. But no matter how
hard he pushed them away, they were
always there, lurking at the back of his
mind. Brother Captain Erasmus Tycho
stood and turned to leave the chapel,
stopping as he saw Chaplain
Lemartes standing in the archway, his
face shrouded in the dancing shadows
cast by the electro-flambeaux.

“Were you seeing them again?” asked
Lemartes.


Tycho nodded slowly. “Yes…” he
whispered, “I see them even now, I
can feel his pain, it burns me.”

Lemartes approached Tycho and
placed his hands on his friend’s
shoulders. He had always known it
would come to this, but still he felt
sorrow. Fitting that it should come on
Armageddon. He could see Tycho’s
glassy eyed stare and knew that part
of his mind was no longer here in the
now but had been wrenched back to
the time of the Great Betrayal. To the
last battle of their Primarch
Sanguinius. To his death.


“Have they considered my… request?”
asked Tycho.

“They have, my friend,” replied
Lemartes sadly.

“And?”

“You shall have your wish, Erasmus.
The honour of leading the forlorn hope
into the Tempestora breach on the
morrow is yours. Come, I shall
perform the moripatris.”

                 *****

Arrayed in his newly painted black
armour, Tycho stared fixedly towards
the besieged Hive Tempestora as the
Chaplains moved amongst the men of
the forlorn hope, the first men into the
breach. The first men to die. He felt
his pulse race and his breathing
quicken… The Imperial palace was in ruins
thousand were dead… He blinked and
watched as vast bellied Gargants…
Daemon visaged Titans stalked through the
rubble of Terra like predatory gods, killing and
destroying all in their path… lurched into
firing positions before the hive.
Somewhere in the cratered hell before
him was the enemy whi had horribly
disfigured him all those years ago…
One man’s betrayal had brought them to this,
one man’s vanity and pride. But they had a
chance to end it here. His Emperor had made
the decision to take the fight to Horus and
Sanguinius of the Blood Angels would not fail
him… Chaplain Lemartes stopped
before Tycho and dipped his finger
into a blood filled chalice. He anointed
Tycho’s helmet with blood in the form
of a jagged saltire and said, “With my
blood I commend your soul to the
Emperor. May he watch over you this
day.”

“And you also Dorn,” said Tycho
taking Lemartes’ hand in the warrios’s
grip, wrist to wrist. “One last time,
brother.”

“Yes,” agreed Lemartes, knowing that
Tycho was finally lost to him. “One last
time.”

                  *****

Tycho smashed another Greenskin
from the rubble with a backhanded
sweep of his fist. Bones cracked and
blood sprayed. The top of the breach
was less than ten metres away.
Gunfire stitched a path towards him,
spurts of dust and stone exploding
around him. He felt the powerful
impacts, but ignored them, charging
up the debris strewn slope. Choking
dust and smoke filled the air. All he
could see were shadowly forms before
him… brother Space Marines, their oaths of
loyalty ashes in the dust. He hated them like
nothing he had ever hated before. A blade
swung at his head, striking his shoulders guard
and tearing upwards… Tycho’s golden
mask tore from his rictus face in a
wash of blood and skin. He screamed
in fury, standing at the top of the
breach, sorrounded by his foes.

The Orks swarmed around the Blood
Angels, dying by the dozen as fifty
years of hatred and vengeance poured
through Tycho’s veins. Behind him, the
last Space Marine of the forlorn hope
fall beneath the blades of the Orks…
the others were gone, separated in the
teleportation. He was alone… Tycho fought
with the strength of legend, fighting
and killing all who came near him. He
swept up a fallen sword and continued
the slaughter, the blade rising and
falling, Ork blood sheathing its edge.
No blade could pierce his armour, no
bullet could lay him low. Ork corpses,
scores deep, sorrounded him, his altar
of death.

The smoke parted and a massively
powerful Ork, clad in wheezing
mechanical armour, crunched across
the rubble towards him. Black exhaust
fumes belched from rusted pipes and
enormous claws snapped from each
arm. Tycho snarled as the
unquenchable fury of the Black Rage
finally consumed him utterly… Horus
greatest and most beloved of the Primarchs.
Why? When we could have achieved anything
we dreamed of, why? Horus said nothing,
swinging with his bladed fist. Sanguinius
sprang away from the powerful claw, spinning
behind the Traitor. He leapt feet first at Horus
feeling his foe’s fangs break under his boot
heels. He landed lightly, rolling swiftly to his
feet as Horus attacked again. His back was to
the wall, nowhere to go but forwards. The two
brothers met blade by blade and Sanguinius
knew that he could not defeat Horus. The sword
snapped and Horus smashed the claw through
his armour and deep into his belly. Excruciating
agony ripped upwards into his ribcage as Horus
tore his heart out. Sanguinius spat blood into
his brother’s face and hissed. “I die, but you
will die with me, traitor!” as he lashed out with
his fist and ripped out his foe’s throat in a
welter of blood. He felt Horus’ grip slacken and
slumped to the ground, his lifeblood pumping
from his broken body. He could vaguely hear
his companions calling his name, but with each
second their voices grew dimmer. He had not
failed his Emperor. He smiled and closed his
eyes as life slipped away.

                      *****

Lemartes watched the small group of
Space Marines as they bore their
Captain on their shoulders towards the
Imperial lines. The breach had fallen
and the outer ring of fortifications and
bunkers were now in Imperial hands.
Tycho had held the breach long
enough for the rest of the army to
reach the walls and carry the day.
With a tenderness that belied the
gore-streaked appearance of the
Blood Angels, they laid Brother
Captain Erasmus Tycho at the feet of
Chaplain Lemartes. He knelt by the
bloody corpse, laying a hand on his
brow and staring at his friend’s face.
Perhaps it was just the relaxation of
muscle that followed death, but he
believed he could see a softening in
Tycho’s features, as though the
terrible disfigurement done to him
had retreated within his flesh. He
hoped so.

“Farewell brother,” he whispered. “You
will not be forgotten.”

The candles flickered as the Sanctum
door was quietly opened. The
Adeptus Sororitas novice padded
softly across the marble floor
through the cloud of incense,
standing respectfully behind the
kneeling Sister Superior. She waited
patiently for acknowledgment.

‘Yes, my child?’ asked Sister
Superior Candida without looking up
from her devotions.

‘The mob approaches, Sister.’
whispered the novice, her voice
betraying her unease. ‘It will be at
the gates soon.’

Sister Candida was remaining kneeling
as concluded her prayers.

‘Give us strength, Divine Lord. May
your will be done.’

She stood, turning from the effigy
of the Emperor to face the young
novice. ‘Fear not, my child. The
Emperor is with us. Whe shall’

The stout, wooden doors of the
cathedral were thrown open as the
Battle Sisters marched onto its steps,
chanting hymns to the Emperor and
raising their ritually blessed weapons
of faith. Bolter shells rained down
the steps and arcane weaponry
spouted cleansing fire. High above,
the angelic forms of the Seraphim
dropped from the dark, towering
spires, bolt pistols spitting death.

Sister Superior Candida stood at the
top of the marble steps, her bolter
kicking in her arms as she pumped
shell after shell into the heretics.
The light from inside the cathedral
framed her in a glowing halo of
brilliance.

‘Death to the defilers!’

The canyons of the ruined city trapped the smoke, dust and noise of battle, turning
each rubble-choked street into a hell of half-glimpsed shadows and phantoms. Trooper
Korkin nervously licked his lips, glancing up the shattered street along the gunsight of
his lascannon. There were reports of Eldar movements in this sector and he didn’t want
to suffer the same fate as 1st Platoon. They’d been found cut to shreds with the
safeties still on their guns. He and Frederiks were positiones a hundred metres in
front of their platoon, an early warning in case the decadent aliens came this way. The
though didn’t comfort him much. Korkin cocked his head as a low humming
penetrated the crash of distant artillery and he watched the smoke suddenly part as
though brushed by an invisible hand. The sleek prow of an Eldar vehicle emerged
seconds later. Korkin squeezed the trigger on the lascannon, watching as the powerful
beam rippled as though travelling through water before it struck the fast-moving
vehicle. Korkin’s jaw fell open as the blast scored the vehicle’s side, but did no further
damage. A warm, electric sensation enveloped him as the Wave Serpent’s energy field
washed over him and he never saw the blow from the Striking Scorpion’s chainsword
that killed him.

The cavernous chamber was lit by flickering candles and filled
with chanting cultists, its walls daubed with blasphemous sigils.
Men, women, children and a hooded figure in robes of silk and
ermine murmured forbidden chants, standing within a group of
hideous runes painted in a garish pink substance on the floor.

‘Knyas’muad arnitisui motriu’nkya Tzeentch!’ called the robed
figure, the language unknown and the words seeming to stretch
the fragile skein of reality to breaking point. Suddenly, the very
fabric of the universe tore, a gaping wound opened in the meat of
space and time, a gateway to the warp itself. Pulsing, obscene
light, chittering voices and horrific gurglings radiated from the
rent, questing tendrils of unseen abominations sensing the warmth
of the material universe.

A filthy, glowing mass pushed itself clear and began coalescing
into its hideously twisted and daemonic form. Images scudded
across its amorphous body. Faces twisted out of the jelly-like
immaterium, sliding out of true, tenebrous screams issuing from
bloated mouths and wailing, nonsensical gibbering echoing from
the cavern walls. Designs within designs, patterns within patterns
and form upon form warped through the light’s awful geometries,
as it sought to find a form more solid than the fluid matter it
had been born into.

‘Our Master comes!’ breathed the robed figure in rapture.

“The Codex Astartes is the holy tome of these loyal Battle
Brothers. The wisdom of the ancients is both scripture and
the unbending rod by which they are measured. In war, they
are fierce and as steadfast as those of old who stood beside
the Emperor and broke the Legions of Horus. In faith and
valour they are unmatched. The torches of their chapels
burn bright with flames whose holy fire has shone upon an
unchanging brotherhood for a hundred centuries. In their
lives and in war, the Codex Astartes is their guide.”

The courage shown by the officers and men of the Company was
inspirational. They carried out their duty to the Emperor with
exemplary determination and skill. In difficult circumstances they
managed to acquit themselves in the manner expected of the Regiment.
The selflessness and sacrifice demonstrated by the entire Company
is, and will remain, a shining example of bravery. There were no
survivors of the action.

The Daemon has many forms. You must
know them all. You must tell the
Daemon from his disguises and root him
out from the hidden places. Trust no-one.
Trust not even yourself. It is better
to die in vain than to live an
abomination. The zealous martyr is
praised for his valour: the craven and
the unready are justly abhorred.

The Daemonic leads to two crimes.
You turn from the path of
righteousness. And you abandon the
Emperor as the object of your
devotion. For the first, death is
merely a just retribution. The second
is a heresy so terrible that no
punishment can be sufficient. Yet the
search for an appropriate penalty
continues, and it shall be found.

“The Despoiler comes forth once again, and he cannot be stopped
by force of arms alone. It is his will that the stars be stained red
with the blood of all who oppose him. An infinite horde of fiends,

alive. But he will not stop there.

If our faith in the Emperor and our force of arms prove strong,
the forces of Chaos can be driven back into hell. If we are found
wanting, Humanity will fall.”

The interior of the prison shuttle was
gloomy, the only light coming through a
weak shaft from a window-slit above the
pressure door. The heavy breathing of men in
deep sleep was the only sound to be heard,
with the odd shuffle of muttered curse as
one or other of the somnolent prisoners
relived some familiar nightmare.

A rattle of chais and the clump of heavy
boots on the metal boarding ramp sounded
from outside, but in their exhaustion not one
of the men inside stirred. The pressure door
hissed open, artificial light blazing in to
chase the shadows into the corners of the
shuttle’s high ceiling. Blinking, stretching and
groaning, the prisoners responded to this
unwelcome wakening. A large silhouette
shuffled lopsidedly up the ramp to stand in
the entrance, its sizeable frame blocking out
most of the light. Heavy chains hung from
the man’s wrists and ankles, connected to a
spiked metal collar around his neck. His mad
eyes
glared into the cell, not really seeing
anything at all.

Two of the prison guards appeared behind
the prisoner and shoved him forward. The
man stumbled a few steps and then tripped
on the doorway rim, falling head first down
onto the mesh decking. He was immediately
back on his feet, growling and snarling
around the leather gag between his teeth. He
took a step forward and the guards reacted
immediately, their suppression mauls lashing
out, sending shockwaves of power across the
brute’s body. After several seconds the man
slumped to his knees and the storm of
blows stopped.

‘Emperor’s teeth, this guy’s an animal!’
someone hissed.
 
‘No talking,’ barked Colonel Schaeffer as he
strode up the ramp and stood at the edge of
the doorway, hands behind his back clasping
a swagger stick. He turned for a moment
and said something to a man beside him
with a heavily scarred face and neck. The
man nodded and then disappeared down the
ramp. Schaeffer turned his attention back to
the prisoners.

‘Take off the shackles,’ he ordered the
guards, his gaze fixing on the man on the
ground.

‘T-take them off?’ one of the guards replied,
giving a horrified glance towards the Colonel.

The Colonel didn’t move, although there was
a slight twitch in his clenched jaw.

‘I do not repeat orders,’ the Colonel replied
tersely, his stare still levelled at the half-
conscious figure on the deck. The guard who
had spoken hurried forward whilst the other
stood ready with his power maul. Pulling a
las-chisel from his belt, the guard burnt out
the rivets on the shackles and they dropped
to the floor with a heavy clang. He stepped
back hastily as the figure pushed himself to
his feet. His hair was matted with sweat,
every muscle in his body twitching with
unnatural tension, and as he turned around
his eyes fell upon the Colonel. With a roar,
he launched himself at Schaeffer, his huge
hands outstretched to grab the Colonel’s
throat. The guards froze in horror, but as the
prisoner lunged towards Schaeffer, the
Colonel stepped back and brought his hand
up sharply. The heel of his hand smashed
into the bridge of his attacker’s nose,
splashing blood across the Colonel’s heavy
dress coat. The man crashed to the deck, his
forehead bouncing off the tip of Schaeffer’s
highly polished left
boot. Rolling over and sitting up, the
prisoner shook his head, and then pushed
himself away from Schaeffer with dazed,
worried glances.

‘Welcome to the rest of your short life!’
called out Mikhaels, the woman the others
called ‘Rocket-Girl’. Grim laughter followed
her comment, which stopped abruptly as the
Colonel snapped the swagger stick in half
with a loud crack.

‘You are all on half water rations today, for
that.’ he told them, stepping forward into the
cell itself and flinging the splintered pieces
of the swagger stick outside. ‘The salvation
of your souls is no laughing matter.’

The newcomer was coming to his senses once
more. Wiping blood from his nose with the
back of his hand, he looked around the
shuttle cell, as if realising where he was for
the first time. His eyes had lost some of
their glazed look.

‘Where the frag am I?’ he asked slowly,
turning to the man in a scuffed officer’s
greatcoat crouching next to him. Everyone
looked at Schaeffer, trying to gauge his
mood - sometimes he was merely surly, and
sometimes he was downright mean.

‘Go ahead, Green, tell him.’ the Colonel
replied to their questioning looks, his face
totally unreadable.

‘You’ve just been volounteered for the Last
Chancers,’ the man the others had
immediately dubbed ‘Hero’ explained dryly
‘For your crimes against the Emperor and
humanity, you will spend your life in this,
the XIII Penal Legion, until such time as
you receive the Emperor’s Absolution from
the Colonel or from the Emperor himself.
And of course, the only way you can receive
the Emperor’s personal absolution is when
you’re dead…’

‘That’s what you are told when you
volunteer,’ growled Schaeffer. He stalked over
and bent down towards the newest ‘volunteer’,
who visibly flinched at the Colonel’s icy
stare. ‘You’re all here because you are traitors
to Mankind and the Immortal Emperor. You
are here because you have failed in your
sworn duy to protect his domains and
subjects, and you have perverted his trust in
you for your own misguided ends. You have
sacrificed your part in securing the future of
the whole humanity for your own selfish
gain. To kill you would be to accept that
you can longer save your immortal souls. If
you were to be ushered into the Emperor’s
presence now, the scales would tip badly
against you when the deeds of your life are
weighed up by his Almighty Presence. This
is why I give you a last chance to prove
yourselves worthy of the Emperor’s
forgiveness. This is why you are here - to
save yourselves from eternal damnation.’

He turned away for a moment, taking two
steps towards the door before whirling on
his heel. His eyes flashed dangerously, his
mouth set in a grimace of disgust.

‘You will atone for your sins, and when you
die you will thank me for allowing you to!’
he snarled, his eyes sweeping across all of
the gathered prisoners.

‘You!’ the Colonel hissed, pointing towards
the kleptomaniac ‘Fingers’ Vagin. ‘Why are
you here?’

‘Cause I canna help stealin’ stuff?’ Fingers
replied tentatively.

‘No,’ whispered Schaeffer, shaking his head
slowly, his hands tightening into fists behind
his back. ‘You are all here because you are
scum. But you are the Emperor’s scum. You
have the skills that are useful to our Immortal
Lord and whether you wish it or not, they
will be made use of.’ 

With a last contemptious look, the Colonel
turned and marched down the ramp, followed
by the two prison guards. The man with the
scarred face reappeared at the doorway, giving
them a once over with his single eye - the
other was covered with a metal eyepatch
riveted into his face. Liutenant chevrons
were stitched onto the front of his flak
jacket, and his aged face looked as if it had
borne all the cares of the galaxy for a
hundred years.

‘What ’appens to us now?’ Vagin asked the
stranger.

‘Now?’ the man replied with a grim smile on
his face. ‘Now you’re shipped out to some
hellhole you’ve never heard of. There you’ll
fight for the Colonel. Most likely you’ll die.
But if you’re lucky, or as good as some of
you think you are, then you might just crawl
out of there alive. And then you’ll go to
another warzone and another battle, and you’ll
stare death in the face again. And again and
again until one day you’re just a little bit
too slow, or just plain unlucky, and you
catch a bullet or a knife, or a plasma grenade
blows you to bits.’

In the stunned silence that followed, the
Liutenant started laughing, the harsh,
uncaring sound becoming muffled as he hit
the controls and the door slammed down,
plunging them into darkness once more.

The Ork Killer Kan toppled backwards, thick black smoke spewing
from its interior and rivulets of molten metal streaming from the
plasma impacts. An injured creature struggled to free itself from the
wreckage, roaring in anger. Brother Janus of the Imperial Fists swung
the turret-mounted plasma guns around, searching for fresh targets as
the Razorback sped forwards, crushing the remains of the Ork
machine.

A solid wedge of Rhinos was charging forwards across the ash plain,
billowing clouds of choking dust blotting out the sun. An entire
Company hurtled towards the Ork held factory complex in Rhino
APCs. Every second vehicle was a Razorback, providing the assault
with much needed fire support. Lascannons, heavy bolters, plasma
guns and multi-meltas laid down wave after wave of punishing
firepower, preventing the Orks from picking off the Imperial tanks
as they sped towards the complex.

Janus saw a mob of Gretchin dragging some kind of artillery piece
forward into cover and cranked the turret around. White-hot bursts
of plasma vaporised the first Gretchin, and the rest ducked hurriedly
into cover as more searing bolts hissed around them. A lucky shot
struck the ammo cart of the gun and blew it high into the air,
lethal shrapnel killing everything nearby. Janus smiled as he watched
burning Gretchin run screaming. The Rhinos alted and
Space Marines began disembarking from their transports. Janus
worked the plasma guns left and right, continuing to pour fire on
the Ork positions, burning anything he could see as the Space
Marines swept into the factory.

The pylon had been looming in our windscreen for a while
now, and Fischig swept us around it, almost kissing the
black stone. The moaning song of the wind as it laced
through the geometries of the pylon was now so loud I
could hear it over the racing turbines of the speeder.

The pylon was vast: half a kilometre high and a quarter
square. The upper facing of the smooth black stone was
machined with delicate craft to form holes and other
round-edged orifices no bigger than a man’s head. It was
through these slim, two hundred and fifty metre tubes that
the wind moaned and howled.

And the tubes weren’t straight. They wove through the
pylon like worm tunnels. Tech-magi had tried running tiny
servitor probes through them to map their loops, but
generally the probes didn’t come back.

As we banked up higher for another pass, I could see the
distant shape of the neighbouring pylon, across the moors,
sixty kilometres away. Five thousand, eight hundred and ten
known pylons dot the surface of Cadia, not counting the two
thousand others that remain as partial ruins or buried relics.

No two are identical in design. Each one rises to a precise
half kilometre height and is sunk a quarter kilometre into
the ground. They predate mankind’s arrival in this system,
and their manner of manufacture is unknown. They are
totally inert, by any auspex measure known to our race, but
many believe their presence explains the quieting of the
violent warp torrents that makes the Cadian Gate the
single, calm navigable route to the Ocularis Terribus.

The training I undertook upon my assignment to the 122ⁿᵈ Cadian Regiment
was different from the normal activities involved in most regimental
training. I has thus far undergone in my career with the Imperial
Commissariat. My initial surprise was the youth of my companions in the
basic training program, all of whom were much, much younger than myself,
the oldest being perhaps fourteen. I had heard the Cadians began
their training young, but frankly, this astonished me, though not as much
as the level of competence displayed by such youngsters. At first I was
indignant at being forced to train with children, but I was soon to be
disabused of this notion after witnessing their fitness and skill at
arms.

There were many specialised skills I needed to learn very quickly in
order to operate with the Cadians, and the emphasis was very definitely
on improving my stamina and overall strength. For too long I had ridden
in the cupola of a Chimera and the first days of training were harder
than any battle I have fought in. But I was determined to uphold the
honour of my position and refused to fail. In short, after three months
I could run, jump and fight for prodigious distances carrying a
significant weight. Such activities required special determination and
failure is not an option for troopers in the Cadian Regiments. As a newly
assigned Commissar, I had to perform doubly well to earn the respect of
the soldiers.

One of the biggest factors in the Cadian training program is
learning to function as a team. Every challenge and
exercise is undertaken in groups of at least squad
size (and frequently larger) and it is crucial
that the soldiers learn to operate effectively
together. We learned how to move at pace as an
entire group - known as speed marching in the
Kasrkin, and something of an art form. We
also learned the difference between
operating as an individual and as part of
a squad (something I had not previously
considered valuable). Many times during my
first three months I almost faltered and
was forced to rely on my squad to get
through a number of challenges.

It soon became clear to me that it is a
ritual amongst the Cadian troopers to
try and outperform anyone they
perceive as an outsider, and this
insular nature was one of the many
hurdles I had to overcome in my
time with the 122ⁿᵈ. But say what
you will about Cadians, they
are amongst the strongest and most
thoroughly disciplined formations
I have ever had the honour of
serving with.

The very air gibbered with the horror
of the Daemon Prince. It towered
above its minions, fully encased in
bronze armour that smoked as though
fresh from the furnace, the ground
running molten beneath the giant’s
white-hot step. Black horns curved
from the side of its skull, twin red
coals burned beneath the helmet’s
visor and powerful, scaled wings
sprouted from its shoulders. The
dread Abhotha, Scourge of a Million
Worlds, carried a monstrous daemon-
axe in one vast gauntlet and a long,
barbed spear in the other. Its shaft
was the thighbone of a Slaaneshi
daemon, the blade pulsing a dull red.
The spear exuded a loathsome hunger
and the axe moaned as though
scenting the blood soon to be spilt.
The Daemon Prince was a living
engine of death, existing for slaughter
and the laying of skulls at Khorne’s
brass throne. That was its only
purpose and it neither wanted or
needed another. Death had come to
this world.

THE WAR IN THE WEB

His heart was beating a rapid tattoo within his chest,
and Nadien had to concentrate to contain his
excitement. It was difficult to do so this close to the
Avatar’s throne room, and doubly so on the eve of
battle, but it would not do to show such an unseemly
display of emotion before his Farseer. Eldrad Ulthran
had called him here to the Dome of Crystal Seers by
name and, though he was intensely curious as to why,
given that he was a warrior not a seer, he was impatient
to return to his training. Niadien carried his helmet in
the crook of his arm, the flexible wraithbone armour
feeling natural against his body and the spirits of its
former wearers filling him with the urge to fight. Dimly,
he remembered the moment he had forsaken the life
of Niadien the poet to become Niadien the Striking
Scorpion Exarch, but that was a long time ago, and
such thoughts were fleeting and ephemeral in the face
of the prospect of battle against the forces of the
ancient enemy. The wraithbone of the Craftworld
pulsed with aggression and thrumming current of
barely suppressed violence saturated every Eldar with
the lust for battle. The Avatar was close to waking and
its dreams of violence and bloodshed permeated every
facet of Ulthwé. The air sang with the promise of battle
and Niadien felt its call resonate in every fibre of his
being.

“The Bloody Handed One calls to you, does he not,
Niadien?” said a soft voice behind him. He spun, hand
involuntarily reaching for his sword, but relaxing as he
saw the venerable Farseer. Eldrad Ulthran made his
way awkwardly through the softly glowing crystal
trees of the dome, leaning heavily on his ornately
carved staff. Niadien saw that his flesh shone with a
faint, crystalline light, the skin translucent and
unyielding.

Niadien nodded curtly. “Yes, I can feel his heat burning
in my veins. The call to war is one I cannot refuse.”

“I know,” said Eldrad softly. “It is your appointed path,
and to deny that is to walk the road that has but one
end.”

Eldrad stopped beside a long and gracefully curved
crystal tree, its structure veined with darting lights and
the suggestion of a peaceful face swimming in its
depths.

“These are dark times for our people, Niadien,” began
Eldrad. “The one called the Despoiler readies his
armies and the Mon-Keigh do not heed my warnings.”

“What has this to do with us, Lord Ulthran?” growled
Niadien. “If the Mon-Keigh wish to destroy
themselves, let them. Ulthwé is all that matters.”

The Farseer nodded. “Normally I would agree with
you, but there are other forces at work here, Niadien.
The silver warriors of the Yngir have returned.”

“The Necrontyr? After so long?”

“Yes. They seek to destroy the remaining Talismans of
Vaul and without them, we are helpless against the
star gods.”

“We should have taken them from the Mon-Keigh
before they could lose them to the Despoiler,” said
Niadien, unable to contain the venom in his tone.

“True,” agreed Eldrad, “but the Jackal God’s foresight
stretches from the dawn of time and eclipses even
mine. He isolated the Gothic sector and we had not
the strength to stop him. But there is worse, Niadien.
Ahriman, the sorcerer of the Red Cyclops, has
breached the webway and he brings his soulless
warriors and the power of ancient magicks.”

Niadien recoiled in horror at the thought of a minion
of Chaos within the sacred pathways of the Eldar.
Such an affront could not be tolerated and his
warrior’s spirit burned with fury at this upstart Mon-
Keigh’s temerity.

“He seeks the Black Library and the ancient
knowledge it contains. He must not discover it, for
there are secrets it keeps that should never have been”
revealed, even to us.”

“He will not discover it while I draw breath,” assured
Niadien. “My strike force is assembled and our
webway portal is prepared. We await only your order
to depart. Send us to war, Lord Ulthran!”

“In time, Niadien, in time,” soothed Eldrad, staring
wistfully at the crystal trees of his ancestors; Farseers
stretching back to the time of the Fall. “The Dark Kin
are also aware of the breach in the webway and mass”
for war. Their efforts to save the twilight city of
Commorragh will be vain and the bloodshed they
will unleash will only make things worse. There is one
amongst them who thirsts for my death and he does
not care that his actions will lead his people, as well as
ours, to their doom.”

“What would you have me do, Lord Ulthran?”

Eldrad turned and rested his hand upon the shoulder
guard of Niadien’s armour, feeling the lust for violence
of all the Exarchs who had worn the armour before
Niadien straining to be unleashed in battle once more.

“We must awake the Avatar of Kaela Mensha Khaine,
Niadien We will need his strength and the fury if his
presence to prevail in the coming war. I have seen
many futures leading to this point and in all of them
the Avatar walks among us.”

Niadien felt his heart swell with pride as he realised
what must come next.

“This is why I have called you here,” said Eldrad
mournfully, drawing a garland of wraithornes from a
pouch at his waist.

“You have been chose, Niadien. You are to be the
Young King.”

The Worldeaters Land Raider
rumbled across the debris-strewn
ground in the armoury's outer
courtyard, crushing steel and stone
beneath its armoured treads as small
arms fire pattered harmlessly against
its adamantium skin. Its hull-
mounted heavy bolters raken the
loyalist position, the mass-reactive
shells cutting down Imperial
Guardsmen by the dozen. A missile
speared out from the barricades,
smashing into the vehicle's side.
The explosion rocked the Raider
and slewed it sideways, but the tank
rolled onwards, its thick, multi-
layered armour absorbing the impact.

The Traitor Marine driver gunned
the engine and drove the Raider
straight over the top of the
Imperial position, scattering
Guardsmen and crushing those not
quick enough to dodge the
armoured leviathan. The tracks spun
in the air, throwing up clouds of
dust before the tank crashed down
again. Its twin-linked laser cannons
fired powerful lances of energy at
the bronze doors of the armoury,
blasting them from the building in
a blossom of red flame. The Raider
squealed to a halt, its front ramp
dropping and a hail of combi-bolter
fire spewing from within. The few
defenders that had survived the
explosion were scythed down in a
heartbeat. Terminators in blood red
armour poured from the vehicle,
through the shattered gateway and
into the garrison's armoury.
Resistance was futile.

Thought for the day: Wisdom is the

Honoured inquisitor, allow me to introduce myself to you. My name is Ferdan Kieras, a loyal servant of the God-Emperor
and former pupil of Inquisitor Czevak. It has been both my pleasure and honour to serve the honourable Inquisitor for
nearly five decades in an investigative capacity, seeking out information as well as undertaking other, more esoteric
missions involving xeno creatures. As sign of my truth, I urge you to seek counsel from the Biologist at Nemesis Tessera and
verify the gene sequence data attached to this message. But now to the substance of this missive.

Is it with heavy heart I bring to your attention the disappearance of my master. I fear a terrible fate has befallen him, and
it was his instruction that in such circumstances, I should contact you and seek guidance. It had long been a dread to my
master that the being known as Ahriman of the Thousand Sons discover his whereabouts and force him to reveal hidden
knowledge imparted to him by the Eldar. To fully understand the dire implications of this, I must unfortunately reveal to
you much knowledge that should best remain secret.

As I am sure you are aware, Ahriman was once a Librarian in the Thousand Sons Legion of Space Marines, and under the
tutelage of his Primarch, Magnus the Red, learned much of the ways of sorcery. In time his mastery of blasphemous magicks
was almost equal of his cyclopean Primarch and his knowledge of forbidden lore corrupted him beyond redemption.
The Thousand Sons were also tainted and Ahriman realised that the Legion would soon be reduced to little more than
gibbering monstrosities. He conceived a great spell to save the legion, called the Rubric of Ahriman. Its energies were more
powerful than he could possibly have anticipated and its effects on the Thousand Sons devastating. Only those with
sorcerous powers were spared its effect, while the remainder of the Legion were reduced to dust within their sealed
suits of armour, becoming little more than fighting automatons. Enraged with Ahriman’s betrayal, Magnus cast him out and
since that day, Ahriman has sought ever more powerful artifacts to increase his understanding of the Warp.

One source of lore that has always eluded him is the Black Library, a vast repository of ancient secrets collated by the
Eldar and gathered together in a hidden place, unknown to the eyes of Man. Only those pure of heart and with the strength
of mind to comprehend the scale of such awful knowledge may enter this place and sup from its wisdom, and my master was
one such individual. Ahriman has long sought Inquisitor Czevak in order to wrest the location of the Black Library from
his mind, but through cunning and machination, my master has thus far eluded his nemesis. But recent developments lead
me to believe that the dread sorcerer has finally caught up with him. A Savant in my employ, having accessed secret files
of the Ordo Malleus regarding Ahriman, was recently found dead, and psychometric readings revealed and individual who
could be none other than Ahriman himself as his killer. A number of other incidents, at first glance unconnected, but upon
further scrutiny linked in the subtlest of ways, all point to the same dire conclusion. My master’s last contact was in the
region of space known as the Sentinel worlds and it is here that I shall begin my search. I shall investigate further, but
it seems clear to me that Ahriman of the Thousand Sons has ensnared Inquisitor Czevak.

If this proves to be the case, then I urge you to use whatever power you can bring to bear on this matter and despatch all
force that can be gathered to hunt down this heretic sorcerer and stop him before he achieves whatever nefarious plan he
intends to implement.

Yours in desperate need,

Kieras

zero-zero. I urge you to bring the Tower of
Angels and all the might of our Chapter to
Agrapinna sector. One-zero-zero’s machinations
have destabilized the entire sector and
provoked a substantial response from the
Ecclesiarchy. Stealth will not serve. We will
need to fight our way through to him. That
he should be sighted so openly, so close to
the remains of Caliban in times such as
there demands urgency.

I believe that the Gate is about to be
stormed. Our final reckoning with the Fallen
is at hand.

Trooper Douro: Sir, I put a plasma gun
shot dead centre on the machine’s chest
and saw it go down. It didn’t make any
difference, they kept coming, no matter
how much fire we poured into them. I lost
count of how many shots I fired, but half
the time these things just got back up
again!

Colonel Montague: You are sure the weapons
were properly consecrated before the
engagements? The war spirits were honoured?

Trooper Douro: Yes, damn it, we- [Sergeant
Bullen administer physical correction for
use of inappropriate language before a
senior office] Yes… yes, the weapon
spirits were honoured.

Colonel Montague: The continue. What
happened next.

Trooper Douro: I saw Lukiz and Hucks
collapse, their skin and muscle stripped
from their bodies by these metal daemons’
weapons, it was horrible. The Chimera was
giving us some good fire support, but
even that could barely keep them at bay.
Our line was holding, just, but then I
saw a swarm of gleaming, beetle-like
things sweep over our heads and attach
themselves to the tank. Before we knew
what was happening they detonated and
blasted the Chimera’s turret clean off.
One of them must’ve hit the magazine… a
second later it blew sky high, taking two
of Red Company’s squads with it.

Colonel Montague: Did you see anything
other than the mechanical warriors and the
swarming machines that destroyed the
Chimera.

Trooper Douro: Uh… yes. Like I said, no
matter how hard we hit ’em, we, couldn’t
stop their advance, but we were still
putting a lot of ’em down. Then as I went
back to get more plasma cells for my gun,
I saw this weird black ligth, like a
miniature tornado suddenly appear behind
Blue Company’s heavy weapons platoon. I
shouted a warning, but it was too late.
More of these mechanical devils emerged
from that darkness and fired a volley of
shots into them. [Subject sobs
uncontrollably for several minutes until
disciplinary correction administered by
Sergeant Bullen] Sorry… then this
creature in crumbling robes and carrying a
staff that crackled with power was amongst
them and carved them up. I saw the
Captain cut in two and Commissar Vaughn
was ripped apart by this monster’s
bodyguard. The rest of the platoon broke
and ran, but I was quicker. I managed to
get to the bunker and, Emperor forgive
me, I locked the door and hid. I didn’t
come out for three days but, when I did,
there was nothing left.

Colonel Montague: You are a disgrace to
the regiment, Douro. You are scum of the
worst kind, a deserter and a coward and I
shall take great pleasure in watching your
execution. Take him away sergeant.

Upon the dead world of Cthelmax, our
Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator team
researched the ruins beneath the
fractured crust of this barren rock.
Several previous expeditions to this
planet had already been lost, but an
entire company of veteran soldiers and a
squad of Space Marines guarded this
expedition. Upon our arrival at the site
of the previous expedition, we were
astounded to find a battle underway
between a group of dark-armored
warriors and strange silver-skinned
constructs of gleaming metal. They
fought before a pipping gateway of
jade-veined darkness as a being with
skin of shimmering gold killed the
warriors with ease, each languorous blow
from its hand cutting a warrior down.

But I saw that, alone among the dark
warriors, a single figure darted through
the combat, fired twin pistols, and
evaded every blow. As the golden being
turned to face him, he slashed its torso
with a shining silver knife. No sooner
had the blade struck than it was
wrenched from his hand and swallowed
whole within the being’s golden flesh.
The sounds of battle continued, and a
dark veil dropped around the
combatants. When next I looked, there
was no sign that anything had occurred.
The area was completely empty.

WHY ORK BLOOD IS RED…

Segment CXVI: ork Physiology and pigmentation by Genetor-Major Anzion

TRANSMITTED: .............................BELIAL V
RECEIVED: ................................GYNDRA
DATE: ....................................3203997.M53
TELEPATHIC DUCT: .........................Astropath-terminus Holroyd
REF: .....................................Inq.XR.01044310/A.sub34
AUTHOR: ..................................GENETOR-MAJOR ANZION
THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: .....................MARTYR THYSELF

Many novitiates have queried me in the past as to why, given the symbiosis of
algal material in Ork DNA, their greenish pigmentation is apparent only in their
skin and not other parts of their anatomy such as blood plasma, inside the
mouth, internal organs, and so on. The answer to this is simple. Much like more
primitive plant forms, the green pigment of Orks is produced by photosyntesis
occurring in algae just beneath the skin, a phenomenon which does not affect
internal tissues. This means that an Ork’s blood, with its oxygen-rich
haemoglobin, is just as red as that of homo sapiens and often more so due to
its enhanced capacity for carrying oxygen.

With the thrice-damned renegades of lewd Slaanesh,
your well-tried techniques of forceful inquisition will
serve you ill. These voluptuaries and heretics that
debase themselves before their so-called Lord of Dark

truths by subtle pressures or the keen probing of your
instruments. Conspiring against all decency even in
such matters, these libertines take pleasure from our

dissolution upon the racks and wheels of Verity. For
these abominations, other methods are required…

You may say he doesn’t exist, but I
know better. When I was crewing on
an ore freighter back in '73, we were
laid up on Dagohma making repairs.
That was the time the mining
Guilders sent in their hired guns to
clear the colonists from the Shantos
Hills. The colonists were all for
packing up and leaving until Cypher
arrived, but his prowess and his words
gave them courage. Before long, the
Guilder compound was under siege.
He didn’t stay till the end, but by
then, there was no stopping the
colonists. They stormed the compound
and hanged the Guilders from their
strip-mining rigs. No one else could
have done what he did - so what if
he didn’t tell anyone his name? When
the Space Marines Angels of Death
arrived weeks later, he was all they
were interested in, but no one told
them anything, even when they were
declared rebels and the trials began.
No one forgot what he had done for
them. They died proud and free.

You must face the truth squarely and without flinching from duty.
Our Enemies are mortal no longer. Mercy for such as they is a
chimera, self-deception is its only ally. Dedicate this weapon, given
unto your hand at the behest of the Emperor, to their destruction.
Regard its function as your only duty: you live only to bring cleansing
fire. Take up your rod and staff, your armour and psycannon, and
go forth.
