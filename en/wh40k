And what are the achievements of
your fragile Imperium? It is a corpse
rotting slowly from within while
maggots writhe in its belly. It was
built with the toil of heroes and
giants, and now it is inhabited by
frightened weaklings to whom the
glories of those times are halt-
forgotten legends. I have forgotten
nothing, and my wisdom has expanded
far beyond mere mortal frailties.

Every segmentum, indeed almost every
sector of the Imperium, has a Cypher
legend, some of them dating back
thousands of years, and the number of
bounties offered for his capture would
buy a subsector were anyone able to
collect them. It is clear that the
popularity of Cypher legends is tied to
nonconformists throughout the Imperium.
Self-deluded radicals believe that
Imperial institutions attempt to repress
individuality and, in a perverse reaction,
subconsciously approve of the maverick
mystery man.

Cypher has become an iconic figure in
the minds of these neurotic radicals. He
is hooded, clearly implying that he is an
outlaw who wishes to avoid recognition,
a pointless gesture because everyone
clearly does recognize him! In fact, most
sightings are only the result of an
imaginative observer conferring Cypher's
identity on some unknown man. Anyone
who foments rebellion and defies capture
can become Cypher in the popular
imagination. Tales commonly emphasize
Cypher's prodigious skill with pistols:
normally he is portrayed firing both a
plasma pistol and a bolt pistol with
unerring accuracy. This technique is
normally associated with hive gangers,
particularly outlaws of the sort that
attract a mystique similare to that of
Cypher. Such “sightings” are clearly a
product of uncontrolled wish fulfillment
rather than accurate observation. Finally
and most perplexing are the frequent
references to the sword that Cypher
carries. There are no credible examples
of the sword being drawn. However, the
rumour most commonly heard is that the
sword is broken and is somehow
connected to the early history of the
Dark Angels. The link with the Dark
Angels is a difficult one to prove, as
they are among the most secretive of
the Adeptus Astartes. It is known that
the Dark Angels and their successor
Chapters sometimes refer to themselves
collectively as the Unforgiven and are
frequently seen hunting down renegade
and traitor Space Marines with or
without official sanction. It is assumed
by some, therefore, that Cypher is a
former Dark Angel and that his sword
may be one of their sacred relics. This
is pure supposition and an insult to the
reputation of the Emperor's most
devoted warriors.

We shall cleanse ourselves in the

name as we dance across the
fallen. Follow me my children,

'Never before or since have I seen fighting such as I witnessed when that host fell upon the Orks.
Seizing the moment, I regrouped my Company and led them once more into the fray, yet there was
little work for us, for the greenskins lacked stomach for the fight. Soon we secured the great
bastion once more and without further loss. Of the dark brotherhood there was no sign.'

“Some called him a monster, a madman. Indeed the line between ecstatic determination and insane ruthlessness is vague
and wavering. It is true that he ordered the bombardment of worlds until they submitted. It is also true that he
would have driven his men into the jaws of death for all eternity had they not finally grown weary. It is true that he
would sometimes order the butchering of whole worlds that opposed his force. But this was not all that he was. He was
magnanimous in victory and many were the times he spared a world that had impressed him with its courage and resolve.
He was a deeply spiritual men too, driven ever onwards for the greater glory of the Emperor, not only his own fame. He
was consumed by his desires, a passionate man who was willing to pay any price to fulfil his dreams of conquest. The
Imperium needed such a man at that time, as it stood on the threshold of greatness once again. The Apostasies had passed,
the Treaty of Ceres had reunited Earth and Mars once again and the Conclave of Mount Amalath was witness to such
great promises. He was the man to fulfil those promises, to stretch out the Emperor's grasp once more. It was he who
dragged the reborn Imperium through the fires of battle, screaming a new birth cry as its golden age came about, the
zenith of Mankind's power. Without him, who is to say what might not have come to pass, what doubts would have been
seeded in the heart of the Imperium once more. No-one can dare say they think of him without humble gratitude for the
marvels he performed. Many men have been dubbed insane for putting into practice what many Saints have preached. Solar
Macharius was such a man.”

The tarot has guided me truthfully as always.
On Amistel, I captured three of the disciples
of a heretic calling himself the Voice of the
Emperor. They proved quite informative. They
received their orders on Lelithar where the cult
of the voice is the strongest. Their descriptions
of the Cult Magos conforms with Fallen one-
zero-zero. I urge you to bring the Tower of
Angels and all the might of our Chapter to
Agrapinna sector. One-zero-zero's machinations
have destabilized the entire sector and
provoked a substantial response from the
Ecclesiarchy. Stealth will not serve. We will
need to fight our way through to him. That
he should be sighted so openly, so close to
the remailns of Caliban in times such as
there demands urgency.

Ibelieve that the Gate is about to be
stormed. Our final reckoning with the Fallen
is at hand.

Upon the dead world of Cthelmax, our
Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator team
researched the ruins beneath the
fractured crust of this barren rock.
Several previous expeditions to this
planet had already been lost, but an
entire company of veteran soldiers and a
squad of Space Marines guarded this
expedition. Upon our arrival at the site
of the previous expedition, we were
astounded to find a battle underway
between a group od dark-armored
warriors and strange silver-skinned
constructs of gleaming metal. They
fought before a pipping gateway of
jade-veined darkness as a being with
skin of shimmering gold killed the
warriors with ease, each languorous blow
from its hand cutting a warrior down.

But I saw that, alone among the dark
warriors, a single figure darted through
the combat, fired twin pistols, and
evaded every blow. As the golded being
turned to face him, he slashed its torso
with a shining silver knife. No sooner
had the blade struck than it was
wrenched from his hand and swallowed
whole within the being's golden flesh.
The sounds of battle continued, and a
dark veil dropped around the
combatants. When next I looked, there
was no sign that anything had occourred.
The area was completely empty.

You may say he doesn't exist, but I
know better. When I was crewing on
an ore freighter back in '73, we were
laid up on Dagohma making repairs.
That was the time the mining
Guilders sent in their hired guns to
clear the colonists from the Shantos
Hills. The colonists were all for
packing up and leaving until Cypher
arrived, but his prowess and his words
gave them courage. Before long, the
Guilder compound was under siege.
He didn't stay till the end, but by
then, there was no stopping the
colonists. They stormed the compound
and hanged the Guilders from their
strip-mining rigs. No one else could
have done what he did - so what if
he didn't tell anyone his name? When
the Space Marines Angels of Death
arrived weeks later, he was all they
were interested in, but no one told
them anything, even when they were
declared rebels and the trials began.
No one forgot what he had done for
them. They died proud and free.
