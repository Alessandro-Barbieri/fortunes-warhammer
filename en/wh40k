“A battle is but one part of a larger whole. Any student of
war will tell you that a wise commander will not commit
to battle unless he has first ensured that it is a fight he
cannot lose. But this still gives the battle an importance it
does not warrant. Fighting a battle, even a battle you
cannot fail to win, is the purest foolishness unless it
advances the chances of ending the need for any further
battles. Your primary aim must always be to win the war,
not win the battle.”

At the end of the st millennium the runic readings of the Farseers were
brimming with dire portents. Eldrad Ulthran’s worst suspicions were
confirmed when Maugan Ra strode throush the Craftworld’s main webway
portal, accompanied by a massive bodyguard of Dark Reapers. The presence
of the Phoenix Lord on Ulthwé affirmed the fact that the Craftworld was
in great peril. Before the hour was out, the Seer Council and Maugan Ra
began a council of war.

Behind the closed doors of the Spirit Chambers, the Farseers vainly probed
the skeins of probability for a safe path through the coming storm. The
sheer scale of the coming conflict was terrifying: the forces of the Mon-
keigh and the minions of Chaos outnumbered the Eldar by millions to one.
There was only one way Eldrad could feasibly alter the course of fate in so
many theatres of such an apocalyptic war.

Whilst the Avatar of Ulthwé was awoken and the Spear of Khaine
assembled to march with him to war. Eldrad fragmented his consciousness,
storing a piece of his psyche in hundreds of sacred Waystones. Maugan
Ra assembled the Black Guardians of Ulthwé, dividing them into small
Strike Forces capable of travelling the convoluted labyrinth of the webway.
With the leader of each detachment carrying a sacred Waystone. Eldrad
could disperse his consciousness across the entire sector, guiding each
Strike Force through the webway to the heart of each battle at exactly
the right time and location. Maugan Ra’s Dark Reaper bodyguard added
to the strenght of the Black Guardians in each Strike Force, and every
member of the Craftworld who could don the mask of the Warlock did
so to better lead their brethren.

When the storm broke, Ulthwé was ready to strike like the lightning.

+++Director, Division Ocular - EYES ONLY

The following are my personal comments to your Lordship only, Overall, while the sheer zeal of this new cult can feel disturbing at first, I
see little cause for worry. As noted above, they have high marks from the regional governor of their originating province - several of the
higher ranking officials are openly strong members of the cult, but continue of course to be loyal to your Lordship. Their basic tenets do
not conflict with the Imperial Creed, though several members of the Ministorum locally have differing opinions on that matter as I’m sure
your Lordship is aware.

This ‘Brotherhood of the Faithful’ preach honest toil, respect for elders, humility, and self-reliance. I was allowed to visit one of their
countryside retreats, and observed the membership in action. All were very properly subservient to me as a recognised agent of your
Lordship, and no attempt was made to hide or conceal anything. I also viewed several church services, and while there were not enough
specific praises to the Emperor of Man for my personal tastes, their more general call to serve the ‘All-Father’ were plentiful and
enthusiastic. When queried, I was told this was the overall name they used in their faith for the Emperor or even your Lordship. They feel
strongly in following the single leading figure in the culture evidently.

Many of the ranking officials wanted to press upon their dedication to your Lordship; I got the feeling they were worried they might be
targeted as heretics. During my meeting with Brother Barantom the young leader of the movement (see transcript above), I got the same
feeling, but more of a confident tone of the fundamental and righteous nature of his faith. Very well spoken, as well as strongly
charismatic fellow. This undercurrent of absolute and utter conviction is one of the things that has made this group grow so well in my
opinion. As noted above, it started out some years ago as an odd cult of re-birth and renewal though faith, represented by the ‘snake
swallowing its own tail’ symbol. [Again, I’m still not sure exactly how long ago; some archived records we have contains clues indicating
this could be an offshoot of an even older religious following dating back several decades at least] Some of the older members still cling to
those older beliefs I would imagine, but has done much better since moving towards a more mainstream belief system.

Quite honestly, I think the main reason the Ministorum is so upset with this group is that they are simply becoming too popular, especially
in the more remote areas away from the capitol. Since they follow the Imperial Creed, they cannot launch an overt attack on the group
though. Thus my official recommendation for continued intensive monitoring and possible infiltration, so we can keep them satisfied by
appearing to be closely watching the situation. But privately, I would recommend your Lordship not waste any more resources than the
bare minimum. This ‘Brotherhood’ is just a passing fancy of the masses, and will fade on its own soon enough with time.

“Diverse and many-fold weaponry is of the
greatest importance for the steel-clad
behemoth, lest it shall be confronted by
foes it cannot master. On the field of war,
it may battle Orks without number, against
whom the burning lance of the lascannon is
worthless. On another world, the armoured
abominations of the alien Eldar may be
found, against whom the noble bolter is
useless.

The commander must maintain the watchful
gaze of the eagle to seek his foes through
scope and slit. Once found, they must be
crushed with the full weight of fire before
seeking the next enemy, for the beast
which is merely maimed may strike back…
still. When a suitable target is found, the
machine must be halted for most
efficacious execution: for motion and
accuracy are anathema to one another.

Every segmentum, indeed almost every
sector of the Imperium, has a Cypher
legend, some of them dating back
thousands of years, and the number of
bounties offered for his capture would
buy a subsector were anyone able to
collect them. It is clear that the
popularity of Cypher legends is tied to
nonconformists throughout the Imperium.
Self-deluded radicals believe that
Imperial institutions attempt to repress
individuality and, in a perverse reaction,
subconsciously approve of the maverick
mystery man.

Cypher has become an iconic figure in
the minds of these neurotic radicals. He
is hooded, clearly implying that he is an
outlaw who wishes to avoid recognition,
a pointless gesture because everyone
clearly does recognize him! In fact, most
sightings are only the result of an
imaginative observer conferring Cypher’s
identity on some unknown man. Anyone
who foments rebellion and defies capture
can become Cypher in the popular
imagination. Tales commonly emphasize
Cypher’s prodigious skill with pistols:
normally he is portrayed firing both a
plasma pistol and a bolt pistol with
unerring accuracy. This technique is
normally associated with hive gangers,
particularly outlaws of the sort that
attract a mystique similar to that of
Cypher. Such “sightings” are clearly a
product of uncontrolled wish fulfillment
rather than accurate observation. Finally
and most perplexing are the frequent
references to the sword that Cypher
carries. There are no credible examples
of the sword being drawn. However, the
rumour most commonly heard is that the
sword is broken and is somehow
connected to the early history of the
Dark Angels. The link with the Dark
Angels is a difficult one to prove, as
they are among the most secretive of
the Adeptus Astartes. It is known that
the Dark Angels and their successor
Chapters sometimes refer to themselves
collectively as the Unforgiven and are
frequently seen hunting down renegade
and traitor Space Marines with or
without official sanction. It is assumed
by some, therefore, that Cypher is a
former Dark Angel and that his sword
may be one of their sacred relics. This
is pure supposition and an insult to the
reputation of the Emperor’s most
devoted warriors.

INQUISITOR THRAX…
…cleared his throat and dictated the last section of his report.

“The mutants have been eradicated throughout the Chapter. The tainted officers
have been slain. The Chapter Master chose to take his own life rather than face
his deserved fate. The creatures he summoned have been banished, or have
returned to the Warp. From past experience, we know that the link, once broken, must needs be
established from our side of the warpgates.”

“That will not happen again in this place. My administration of
justice has made sure of that. The unfortunate lapses of the last
months have been cleansed. Full casualty reports are attached.”

“I can now confidently claim that, under their new - and morally
pure - corps of officers, the reformed Grey Slayers Chapter of

in the past.”

“Hail the Emperor!”

“Thrax, Inquisitor Ordinary, This day of etc etc… Make a good
copy and then return so that I may seal the despatch.”

“Yes, Lord Inquisitor.”

Thrax sat down at the former Chapter Master’s desk. He had a
mind to keep it for his own. The workmanship had a certain naive
charm. The inlay work was particularly fine for a backward world,
such intricate patterns, such a pleasing arrangement of woods
and techplastics. One could almost believe that it all meant
something. His finger idly traced across the surface, following
the line of a swirl and loop…

In Warpspace something stirred. Its name had almost been used.
Soon the Word would be used, and the Way opened. The
summoning was happening. It could feel the drawing together
of power and intent…

Thrax was thinking hard, and now his finger barely moved. The
Chapter Master had been weak, a fool. But the power he had
tapped! Properly used, in the service of the Emperor, could it
not make him the best, the greatest, of all the Inquisitors? His
finger moved across the desktop again, following the inlay…

Soon… Soon…

Thrax reached the end of the techplastic line. He half-turned
towards something in the corner of his eye. And the he knew…

NOW!

There was a knock on the door. The scribe had returned.
“Inquisitor Thrax, I have the copy of your report, Lord.” His
voice filled with doubt. “Inquisitor… Thrax? My Lord?”

would sometimes order the butchering of whole worlds that opposed his force. But this was not all that he was. He was
magnanimous in victory and many were the times he spared a world that had impressed him with its courage and resolve.
He was a deeply spiritual men too, driven ever onwards for the greater glory of the Emperor, not only his own fame. He
was consumed by his desires, a passionate man who was willing to pay any price to fulfil his dreams of conquest. The
Imperium needed such a man at that time, as it stood on the threshold of greatness once again. The Apostasies had passed,
the Treaty of Ceres had reunited Earth and Mars once again and the Conclave of Mount Amalath was witness to such
great promises. He was the man to fulfil those promises, to stretch out the Emperor’s grasp once more. It was he who
dragged the reborn Imperium through the fires of battle, screaming a new birth cry as its golden age came about, the
zenith of Mankind’s power. Without him, who is to say what might not have come to pass, what doubts would have been

fall into his clutches. I shall mobilise the 34th

“The Codex Astartes is the holy tome of these loyal Battle
Brothers. The wisdom of the ancients is both scripture and
the unbending rod by which they are measured. In war, they
are fierce and as steadfast as those of old who stood beside
the Emperor and broke the Legions of Horus. In faith and
valour they are unmatched. The torches of their chapels
burn bright with flames whose holy fire has shone upon an
unchanging brotherhood for a hundred centuries. In their
lives and in war, the Codex Astartes is their guide.”

The courage shown by the officers and men of the Company was
inspirational. They carried out their duty to the Emperor with
exemplary determination and skill. In difficult circumstances they
managed to acquit themselves in the manner expected of the Regiment.
The selflessness and sacrifice demonstrated by the entire Company
is, and will remain, a shining example of bravery. There were no
survivors of the action.

The Daemon has many forms. You must
know them all. You must tell the
Daemon from his disguises and root him
out from the hidden places. Trust no-one.
Trust not even yourself. It is better
to die in vain than to live an
abomination. The zealous martyr is
praised for his valour: the craven and
the unready are justly abhorred.

The Daemonic leads to two crimes.
You turn from the path of
righteousness. And you abandon the
Emperor as the object of your
devotion. For the first, death is
merely a just retribution. The second
is a heresy so terrible that no
punishment can be sufficient. Yet the
search for an appropriate penalty
continues, and it shall be found.

alive. But he will not stop there.

If our faith in the Emperor and our force of arms prove strong,

The weak will always be led by the strong. Where the
strong see purpose and act, the weak follow; where the
strong cry out against fate, the weak bow their hands
and succumb. There are many who are weak; and
many are their temptations. Despise the weak for they

Renegade. Pay them not and scorn their cries of
innocence - it is better that one hundred innocently
fall before the wrath of the Emperor that one kneels
before the Daemon.

Thought for the day: Wisdom is the

Honoured inquisitor, allow me to introduce myself to you. My name is Ferdan Kieras, a loyal servant of the God-Emperor
and former pupil of Inquisitor Czevak. It has been both my pleasure and honour to serve the honourable Inquisitor for
nearly five decades in an investigative capacity, seeking out information as well as undertaking other, more esoteric
missions involving xeno creatures. As sign of my truth, I urge you to seek counsel from the Biologist at Nemesis Tessera and
verify the gene sequence data attached to this message. But now to the substance of this missive.

Is it with heavy heart I bring to your attention the disappearance of my master. I fear a terrible fate has befallen him, and
it was his instruction that in such circumstances, I should contact you and seek guidance. It had long been a dread to my
master that the being known as Ahriman of the Thousand Sons discover his whereabouts and force him to reveal hidden
knowledge imparted to him by the Eldar. To fully understand the dire implications of this, I must unfortunately reveal to
you much knowledge that should best remain secret.

As I am sure you are aware, Ahriman was once a Librarian in the Thousand Sons Legion of Space Marines, and under the
tutelage of his Primarch, Magnus the Red, learned much of the ways of sorcery. In time his mastery of blasphemous magicks
was almost equal of his cyclopean Primarch and his knowledge of forbidden lore corrupted him beyond redemption.
The Thousand Sons were also tainted and Ahriman realised that the Legion would soon be reduced to little more than
gibbering monstrosities. He concieved a great spell to save the legion, called the Rubric of Ahriman. Its energies were more
powerful than he could possibly have anticipated and its effects on the Thousand Sons devastating. Only those with
sorcerous powers were spared its effect, while the remainder of the Legion were reduced to dust within their sealed
suits of armour, becoming little more than fighting automatons. Enraged with Ahriman’s betrayal, Magnus cast him out and
since that day, Ahriman has sought ever more powerful artifacts to increase his understanding of the Warp.

One source of lore that has always eluded him is the Black Library, a vast repository of ancient secrets collated by the
Eldar and gathered together in a hidden place, unknown to the eyes of Man. Only those pure of heart and with the strength
of mind to comprehend the scale of such awful knowledge may enter this place and sup from its wisdom, and my master was
one such individual. Ahriman has long sought Inquisitor Czevak in order to wrest the location of the Black Library from
his mind, but through cunning and machination, my master has thus far eluded his nemesis. But recent developments lead
me to believe that the dread sorcerer has finally caught up with him. A Savant in my employ, having accessed secret files
of the Ordo Malleus regarding Ahriman, was recently found dead, and psychometric readings revealed and individual who
could be none other than Ahriman himself as his killer. A number of other incidents, at first glance unconnected, but upon
further scrutiny linked in the subtlest of ways, all point to the same dire conclusion. My master’s last contact was in the
region of space known as the Sentinel worlds and it is here that I shall begin my search. I shall investigate further, but
it seems clear to me that Ahriman of the Thousand Sons has ensnared Inquisitor Czevak.

If this proves to be the case, then I urge you to use whatever power you can bring to bear on this matter and despatch all
force that can be gathered to hunt down this heretic sorcerer and stop him before he achieves whatever nefarious plan he
intends to implement.

Yours in desperate need,

Kieras

The tarot has guided me truthfully as always.
On Amistel, I captured three of the disciples
of a heretic calling himself the Voice of the
Emperor. They proved quite informative. They
received their orders on Lelithar where the cult
of the voice is the strongest. Their descriptions
of the Cult Magos conforms with Fallen one-
zero-zero. I urge you to bring the Tower of
Angels and all the might of our Chapter to
Agrapinna sector. One-zero-zero’s machinations
have destabilized the entire sector and
provoked a substantial response from the
Ecclesiarchy. Stealth will not serve. We will
need to fight our way through to him. That
he should be sighted so openly, so close to
the remains of Caliban in times such as
there demands urgency.

I believe that the Gate is about to be
stormed. Our final reckoning with the Fallen
is at hand.

Upon the dead world of Cthelmax, our
Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator team
researched the ruins beneath the
fractured crust of this barren rock.
Several previous expeditions to this
planet had already been lost, but an
entire company of veteran soldiers and a
squad of Space Marines guarded this
expedition. Upon our arrival at the site
of the previous expedition, we were
astounded to find a battle underway
between a group of dark-armored
warriors and strange silver-skinned
constructs of gleaming metal. They
fought before a pipping gateway of
jade-veined darkness as a being with
skin of shimmering gold killed the
warriors with ease, each languorous blow
from its hand cutting a warrior down.

But I saw that, alone among the dark
warriors, a single figure darted through
the combat, fired twin pistols, and
evaded every blow. As the golden being
turned to face him, he slashed its torso
with a shining silver knife. No sooner
had the blade struck than it was
wrenched from his hand and swallowed
whole within the being’s golden flesh.
The sounds of battle continued, and a
dark veil dropped around the
combatants. When next I looked, there
was no sign that anything had occurred.
The area was completely empty.

You may say he doesn’t exist, but I
know better. When I was crewing on
an ore freighter back in '73, we were
laid up on Dagohma making repairs.
That was the time the mining
Guilders sent in their hired guns to
clear the colonists from the Shantos
Hills. The colonists were all for
packing up and leaving until Cypher
arrived, but his prowess and his words
gave them courage. Before long, the
Guilder compound was under siege.
He didn’t stay till the end, but by
then, there was no stopping the
colonists. They stormed the compound
and hanged the Guilders from their
strip-mining rigs. No one else could
have done what he did - so what if
he didn’t tell anyone his name? When
the Space Marines Angels of Death
arrived weeks later, he was all they
were interested in, but no one told
them anything, even when they were
declared rebels and the trials began.
No one forgot what he had done for
them. They died proud and free.

You must face the truth squarely and without flinching from duty.
Our Enemies are mortal no longer. Mercy for such as they is a
chimera, self-deception is its only ally. Dedicate this weapon, given
unto your hand at the behest of the Emperor, to their destruction.
Regard its function as your only duty: you live only to bring cleansing
fire. Take up your rod and staff, your armour and psycannon, and
go forth.
