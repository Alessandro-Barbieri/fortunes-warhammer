‘Give me a gun and, yes, I will slay the Imperial
oppressors in the name of the Star Children until
its chambers are empty, its magazine spent. But
give me bombs and I will bring the fastnesses of
the unbelievers crashing down upon their heads. I
will break their engines of war, sever their bridges
and topple their fanes. Let me fight as the Star
Children meant for me to fight, and I will bring
you victory.’
        - Jarsya Dessavane, Reductus Saboteur of the
                               Cult of the Innerwyrm
