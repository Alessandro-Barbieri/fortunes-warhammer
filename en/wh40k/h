‘HERE LIES CELESTIAN SISTER THRENOTAE OSPIS, WHO FOUGHT HER
FIRST BATTLE AGAINST THE UNCLEAN HERETICS OF GHORVANDAX,
WHO ROSE TO COMMAND HER OWN SQUAD AFTER HER SELFLESS
ACTS UPON HULLUS, WHO DEFENDED THE PERSON OF HER WOUNDED
CANONESS DURING THE VAXORMIS PURGE AND SO EARNED A PLACE
AMONGST THE CELESTIANS, WHO SLEW THE RED WITCH OF KHERAN
WITH HER BLESSED BOLTGUN, AND DESPATCHED THE BEAST OF
RAEMNOR WITH A SINGLE SHOT, AND WHO FELL AT LAST RETAKING
THE BLESSED SHROUD OF SAINT ELAHNOR FROM THE CLUTCHES OF
PERFIDIOUS XENOS. HERE SHE LIES, AND HERE IS SHE HONOURED
FOR HER DECADES OF NOBLE SERVICE TO THE EMPEROR’
