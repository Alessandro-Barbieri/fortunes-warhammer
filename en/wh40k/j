                  JUBAL KHAN, GREAT KHAN OF
                       THE WHITE SCARS

When the Great Khan of the White Scars dies, the
Stormseers of the Chapter gather in the deepest caves of the
Khum Karta in the Valley of the Khans to decide upon his
successor. Each Brotherhood Khan who believes himself
worthy must present himself before the Stormseers and
prove himself to them. The horrors the Stormseers subject
each claimant to are a mystery and those that survive the
trials never speak of them. When the Great Khan Kyublai
vanished fighting the Dark Eldar in 943.M41, four hopefuls
gathered in the Khum Karta mountains. Only Jubal Khan
survived the Stormseers’ ordeals and returned to Quan Zhou
to be anointed Great Khan.

Since then, Jubal Khan has proved himself time and time
again, leading many successful campaigns against Orks,
Tyranids, Eldar and countless other alien races. During the
Jopal Uprising, his First Brotherhood was so successful at
destroying enemy supply lines and disrupting communications
that a huge proportion of the main rebel strength was
diverted from the front line operations to deal with them.
Imperial Guard regiments were then able to smash through
the weakened rebel line and bring the insurrection to a close.

Jubal Khan is currently involved in the Armageddon war
where Imperial forces have been stretched to the limit after
Ghazghkull’s invasion. The Great Khan’s forces are launching
lightning raids on Ork held worlds and vanishing like smoke
before the greenskins can muster sufficient forces to engage
them. Thus far hi White Scars have proved to be
instrumental in delaying many Ork offensives, allowing
Imperial garrisons to better prepare for the onslaught. White
Scars operations in the Deadlands region of Armageddon
were so successful that they were able to effectively destroy
an entire Ork brigade without taking a single casualty or
expending a single round of ammunition.
