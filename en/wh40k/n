‘Never before had I seen an act of such achingly divine
worship, nor an instance of such sacred immolation, as
when I bore witness to the day we finally threw down
the Parallax Widow. Emerging from a cratered shell,
pennants smoking and tablets of holy writ cracked, the last
of our Exorcists spoke. I wept as the clarion of invisible
holy choirs swept its consecrated payload to the stars in
an offering to the Emperor's glory. A moment later, he
charitably returned them to consume her tainted court.’

'Never before or since have I seen fighting such as I witnessed when that host fell upon the Orks.
Seizing the moment, I regrouped my Company and led them once more into the fray, yet there was
little work for us, for the greenskins lacked stomach for the fight. Soon we secured the great
bastion once more and without further loss. Of the dark brotherhood there was no sign.'
