to give you will save you on the battlefield.”

ORDO HERETICUS

At the end of the Age of Apostasy,
the Inquisition formed a secret
order within its ranks to watch the
Ecclesiarchy more closely. While the
Inquisition as a whole monitors every
aspect of the Imperium, the Ordo
Hereticus is primarily concerned with
stamping out aberrant faith before it
is allowed to run rampant. Though
the Ecclesiarchy regulates itself and
its followers closely - primarily
through the Adepta Sororitas - the
Ordo Hereticus provides another
line of defence to ensure that those
in power within the Ecclesiarchy do
not abuse their positions to such an
extent that they threaten the stability
of the Imperium. These Inquisitors
watch Wars of Faith closely to
ensure the objectives laid down by
the Ecclesiarch are both justified
and not exceeded by those actually
fighting. They also monitor the
temporary armies known as Frateris
Militia that rally behind members
of the priesthood in theatres of
conflict, ensuring that such forces
are disbanded after they are needed. In
this way the Ordo Hereticus ensures
that the Ecclesiarchy’s standing
military does not reach the levels it
did under Goge Vandire.
