Possession was once nine-tenths of
the lore. It is so even today, but we
must blind ourselves to the tenth
that remains and was once a Human.
Duty requires that we put aside such
considerations and root out
uncleanliness in thought and deed.
There can be no other course of
action. No-one can be adjudged
innocent of compliance. Better to
self destruct than acquiesce.
