‘Pain is the sister
who fights at my
side. Pain recalls to
me my wrongs that
I might strive in
pursuit of penance.
Pain insists that I
stand my ground,
steady my aim and
fight on though my
life blood falls like
rain to the thirsting
soil. Pain is an ally.
Pain is a friend.
Pain is truth.’

      - Sister Erynica

        Valorous Heart

Plainsong, prayer and the crash of armoured feet roll like thunder between the cavernous arches of the Cathedrum Sanctifactum as rank
upon rank of Adepta Sororitas march out on crusade. The galaxy shall feel their wrath!

Possession was once nine-tenths of
the lore. It is so even today, but we
must blind ourselves to the tenth
that remains and was once a Human.
Duty requires that we put aside such
considerations and root out
uncleanliness in thought and deed.
There can be no other course of
action. No-one can be adjudged
innocent of compliance. Better to
self destruct than acquiesce.

PSALM OF SERENE GLORY

Battle hymn of the Order of the Sacred Rose

His light doth shine where hearts be open, and the spirit calls him near

Lo, in glory do the faithful, serve as witness and revere

Emperor, your might resoundeth
O’er the Imperium

Darkness shields not sin nor schism
By our fires your will be done

To the craven wrath be given, keep us in serenity

We your conduits of blessings, liberate Humanity

Emperor, your might resoundeth
O’er the Imperium

Darkness shields not sin nor schism
By our fires your will be done
