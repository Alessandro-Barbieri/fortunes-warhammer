You may say he doesn’t exist, but I
know better. When I was crewing on
an ore freighter back in ’73, we were
laid up on Dagohma making repairs.
That was the time the mining
Guilders sent in their hired guns to
clear the colonists from the Shantos
Hills. The colonists were all for
packing up and leaving until Cypher
arrived, but his prowess and his words
gave them courage. Before long, the
Guilder compound was under siege.
He didn’t stay till the end, but by
then, there was no stopping the
colonists. They stormed the compound
and hanged the Guilders from their
strip-mining rigs. No one else could
have done what he did - so what if
he didn’t tell anyone his name? When
the Space Marines Angels of Death
arrived weeks later, he was all they
were interested in, but no one told
them anything, even when they were
declared rebels and the trials began.
No one forgot what he had done for
them. They died proud and free.

You must face the truth squarely and without flinching from duty.
Our Enemies are mortal no longer. Mercy for such as they is a
chimera, self-deception is its only ally. Dedicate this weapon, given
unto your hand at the behest of the Emperor, to their destruction.
Regard its function as your only duty: you live only to bring cleansing
fire. Take up your rod and staff, your armour and psycannon, and
go forth.
